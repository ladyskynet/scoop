"Paragraph: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and JONATHAN MARTINNOV. 13, 2017\n"
"Paragraph: Roy S. Moore, the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama, was accused of sexual misconduct by a fifth woman. Republicans in the Senate have called for him to drop out of the campaign."
"Paragraph: WASHINGTON — A fifth woman accused Roy S. Moore, the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama, on Monday of making sexual or romantic advances toward her when she was a teenager, as senior Republicans in Washington called for him to drop out of the race and threatened to expel him from the Senate if he wins."
"Paragraph: The new accuser, Beverly Young Nelson, told a news conference in New York that Mr. Moore attacked her when she was 16 and he was a prosecutor in Etowah County, Ala. Ms. Nelson was represented at the news conference by Gloria Allred, a lawyer who has championed victims of sexual harassment."
"Paragraph: “I tried fighting him off, while yelling at him to stop, but instead of stopping, he began squeezing my neck attempting to force my head onto his crotch,” Ms. Nelson said in a statement she issued at the news conference. She said Mr. Moore warned her that “no one will believe you” if she told anyone about the encounter in his car."
"Paragraph: Hours earlier, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, said Mr. Moore “should step aside” and that he believes the women who have accused Mr. Moore of sexual misconduct when they were teenagers."
"Paragraph: “I believe the women, yes,” Mr. McConnell said at a news conference in Louisville."
"Paragraph: Mr. McConnell also said that encouraging a write-in candidate to run in the Dec. 12 special election is “an option we’re looking at.”"
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, speaking in his role as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said that if Mr. Moore wins the special election on Dec. 12, he should be expelled from the Senate, “because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate.”"
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: Mr. Moore, a judge who was twice removed from the state’s high court, first for refusing to remove the Ten Commandments from the Supreme Court grounds, then for refusing to accept gay marriage, responded defiantly. He showed no sign of leaving the race ahead of Alabama’s Dec. 12 special election date."
"Paragraph: \n            The person who should step aside is @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell. He has failed conservatives and must be replaced. #DrainTheSwamp        "
"Paragraph: In an afternoon statement, Mr. Moore’s campaign described Ms. Allred as “a sensationalist leading a witch hunt, and she is only around to create a spectacle.” The statement, issued before Ms. Allred’s news conference in New York, denied again “any sexual misconduct with anyone” by Mr. Moore."
"Paragraph: Republicans here and in Alabama have been up in arms over the accusations, published last week in The Washington Post, that Mr. Moore pursued sexual or romantic relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s. The reports have upended a race in a state that has not elected a Democratic senator in 25 years."
"Paragraph: In a fund-raising appeal, Mr. Moore reached out to his supporters with the subject line: “Mitch McConnell’s plot to destroy me.”"
"Paragraph: “Apparently Mitch McConnell and the establishment G.O.P. would rather elect a radical pro-abortion Democrat than a conservative Christian,” he wrote."
"Paragraph: And Mr. Moore’s wife, Kayla Moore, lashed out in a Facebook post on Monday, complaining about “a witch hunt” in Alabama and claiming that “we are gathering evidence of money being paid to people who would come forward.”"
"Paragraph: “Washington establishment and Democrat Party will stop at nothing to stop our campaign,” she wrote. “Prayers appreciated.....”"
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: But with Mr. McConnell now firmly against his election, Mr. Moore and his candidacy promise to deepen the divide between Republican leaders in Congress and the populist wing of the party that is standing by the Alabamian. Another Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, also called for Mr. Moore to drop out of the race on Monday."
"Paragraph: \n            I have now read Mr. Moore’s statement and listened to his radio interview in which he denies the charges. I did not find his denials to be convincing and believe that he should withdraw from the Senate race in Alabama.        "
"Paragraph: Anxious Republican officials spent much of the weekend trying to determine what, if anything, they could do to halt Mr. Moore without simply turning over the seat. If Doug Jones, the Democratic nominee, wins, it would narrow the Republican advantage in the Senate to a single seat."
"Paragraph: But if Mr. Moore stays in and goes on to win, it could leave Senate Republicans with the difficult question of whether to stop him from being seated or seating him and immediately moving to expel him from the chamber."
"Paragraph: One idea now being discussed under this scenario, brought up by two different White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, would be for Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama to immediately appoint Attorney General Jeff Sessions to what had been his seat when it becomes vacant again. Mr. Sessions remains highly popular among Alabama Republicans, but his relationship with President Trump has waned since he recused himself from the investigation of the role that Russia played in last year’s campaign."
"Paragraph: Republicans in Washington, though, have not ruled out fielding a write-in candidate and some of the party’s outside groups were expected to conduct surveys this week of who would be most formidable prospect, according to officials familiar with the plans."
"Paragraph: Democrats, who have been restrained about their prospects in such a conservative state, said that if additional women like the one joining Ms. Allred tell their stories, it would undermine Mr. Moore’s case that he is being smeared in a single newspaper article."

"Paragraph: By PATRICIA COHENNOV. 13, 2017\n"
"Paragraph: “Slow down” is the last thing that supporters of the Republicans’ proposed tax overhaul want to hear. “My donors are basically saying get it done or don’t ever call me again,” Chris Collins, a representative from New York, said last  week."
"Paragraph: But the rush to “get it done” — particularly on the business side, where the most sweeping changes are planned — is alarming tax specialists who warn that new and unforeseen complexity, loopholes and glitches could come back to haunt tax collectors and taxpayers."
"Paragraph: “All of this is happening in an incredible rush, and frankly it’s absurd and incredibly poor governing to push a bill of this significance in the time frame they’re doing,” said Stephen E. Shay, a senior lecturer at Harvard Law School who worked in the Treasury Department during the Reagan and Obama administrations."
"Paragraph: With accountants, lawyers and lobbyists still poring over the varying versions of the bills released by the House of Representatives and the Senate, some of the loopholes and tax dodges spotted so far — whether unintended or not — include these:"
"Paragraph: ■ A tax designed to prevent giant multinationals from shifting profits offshore also creates new opportunities for small and medium-size firms to use tax havens to slice their tax rate in half."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: ■ A provision aimed at helping small business could turn into a windfall for wealthy investors who use it to lower their tax rate on rental and interest income."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: ■ An incentive to invest in slipshod, money-losing ventures would be created by the combination of a new proposal to immediately expense investments with the Senate’s suggested delay in the corporate tax cut."
"Paragraph: ■ Rules designed to prevent highly paid doctors, lawyers and other service providers from cashing in on new benefits aimed at small businesses can be easily circumvented."
"Paragraph: Even those who applaud the aim of reducing the corporate tax rate and transforming the way global profits are taxed worry that specific provisions will miss the mark."
"Paragraph: Republican leaders, responding to political pressure to move quickly, defend the process, saying Congress has held dozens of hearings on tax reform in recent years."
"Paragraph: Tax bills, by nature complex, are shaped by a galaxy of competing pressures. And withholding details until the final vote as a way of shielding the legislation from special interests is not a new strategy."
"Paragraph: Yet several veterans of previous tax battles argue what is different this time is the mix of breakneck speed and enormous scope."
"Paragraph: Consider the plan’s shift from a worldwide system, where profits are taxed no matter where they are earned, to a territorial system, which exempts profits earned outside the United States, bringing the American tax system in line with those in most other nations."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: Because the switch could end up encouraging American companies to move even more profits offshore to avoid paying any domestic income tax, both the House and Senate versions of the bill impose rules to deter most multinationals with annual revenues of more than $100 million from exploiting such tactics."
"Paragraph: But the effort to catch the giants under the new territorial system sets a financial bar that small and medium-size businesses can limbo under. Mr. Shay said accounting firms were likely to start marketing off-the-shelf tax shelters allowing companies to set up foreign offices in low-tax countries like Bermuda or Luxembourg to shrink their tax bills."
"Paragraph: “They’re just opening us up to the next round of tax shelters on the international side,” he said. “And the I.R.S., underfunded as it is, isn’t going to be able to check anything.”"
"Paragraph: At the same time, he said, some safeguards aimed at multinationals could still be bypassed. To reduce their home tax bill, companies like Google and Pfizer, for instance, often relocate patents and copyrights in tax havens and then sell use of that intellectual property back to their American subsidiaries at eye-popping prices. These are the higher-than-normal profits — which Senate bill drafters have cunningly called “Gilti” (for global intangible low-tax income) — that Republican bills are trying to stop from leaking out of the tax system."
"Paragraph: Multinationals, though, could avoid some of the Gilti tax by shifting more tangible property like production and research facilities abroad."
"Paragraph: Other problems arise from the push to reduce the rate on pass-through businesses (sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations that currently pay taxes at the individual rate). Lawmakers have advertised the cut as relief for smaller businesses, but high-income investors in hedge and private-equity funds could use the provision to reduce the tax paid on rent and interest income by as much as a third."

Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and former legislation counsel with Congress’s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. The funds’ decision to mark their trading positions at their market price (instead of their initial purchase price) would enable any gains to qualify for pass-through treatment at the newly reduced rate of 25 percent instead of being treated as short-term capital gains, at a top rate that nears 40 percent."

"Paragraph: (He offered an  example for the mathematically inclined. Normally no one would invest $100 to earn only $90 back. But under the Senate plan, where some business expenses could be immediately deducted at a 35 percent rate, you would get $35 back in 2018. So your actual cost is $65. By the time your $90 earnings are paid in 2019, though, the tax rate would be 20 percent. That would cost you $18 in taxes, and leave $72 in your wallet. So even though your investment lost $10, you are still coming out ahead: with $72 on a net investment of $65.)"

“Slow down” is the last thing that supporters of the Republicans’ proposed tax overhaul want to hear. “My donors are basically saying get it done or don’t ever call me again,” Chris Collins, a representative from New York, said last  week.But the rush to “get it done” — particularly on the business side, where the most sweeping changes are planned — is alarming tax specialists who warn that new and unforeseen complexity, loopholes and glitches could come back to haunt tax collectors and taxpayers.“All of this is happening in an incredible rush, and frankly it’s absurd and incredibly poor governing to push a bill of this significance in the time frame they’re doing,” said Stephen E. Shay, a senior lecturer at Harvard Law School who worked in the Treasury Department during the Reagan and Obama administrations.With accountants, lawyers and lobbyists still poring over the varying versions of the bills released by the House of Representatives and the Senate, some of the loopholes and tax dodges spotted so far — whether unintended or not — include these:■ A tax designed to prevent giant multinationals from shifting profits offshore also creates new opportunities for small and medium-size firms to use tax havens to slice their tax rate in half.Advertisement■ A provision aimed at helping small business could turn into a windfall for wealthy investors who use it to lower their tax rate on rental and interest income.Advertisement■ An incentive to invest in slipshod, money-losing ventures would be created by the combination of a new proposal to immediately expense investments with the Senate’s suggested delay in the corporate tax cut.■ Rules designed to prevent highly paid doctors, lawyers and other service providers from cashing in on new benefits aimed at small businesses can be easily circumvented.Even those who applaud the aim of reducing the corporate tax rate and transforming the way global profits are taxed worry that specific provisions will miss the mark.Republican leaders, responding to political pressure to move quickly, defend the process, saying Congress has held dozens of hearings on tax reform in recent years.Tax bills, by nature complex, are shaped by a galaxy of competing pressures. And withholding details until the final vote as a way of shielding the legislation from special interests is not a new strategy.Yet several veterans of previous tax battles argue what is different this time is the mix of breakneck speed and enormous scope.Consider the plan’s shift from a worldwide system, where profits are taxed no matter where they are earned, to a territorial system, which exempts profits earned outside the United States, bringing the American tax system in line with those in most other nations.AdvertisementBecause the switch could end up encouraging American companies to move even more profits offshore to avoid paying any domestic income tax, both the House and Senate versions of the bill impose rules to deter most multinationals with annual revenues of more than $100 million from exploiting such tactics.But the effort to catch the giants under the new territorial system sets a financial bar that small and medium-size businesses can limbo under. Mr. Shay said accounting firms were likely to start marketing off-the-shelf tax shelters allowing companies to set up foreign offices in low-tax countries like Bermuda or Luxembourg to shrink their tax bills.“They’re just opening us up to the next round of tax shelters on the international side,” he said. “And the I.R.S., underfunded as it is, isn’t going to be able to check anything.”At the same time, he said, some safeguards aimed at multinationals could still be bypassed. To reduce their home tax bill, companies like Google and Pfizer, for instance, often relocate patents and copyrights in tax havens and then sell use of that intellectual property back to their American subsidiaries at eye-popping prices. These are the higher-than-normal profits — which Senate bill drafters have cunningly called “Gilti” (for global intangible low-tax income) — that Republican bills are trying to stop from leaking out of the tax system.Multinationals, though, could avoid some of the Gilti tax by shifting more tangible property like production and research facilities abroad.Other problems arise from the push to reduce the rate on pass-through businesses (sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations that currently pay taxes at the individual rate). Lawmakers have advertised the cut as relief for smaller businesses, but high-income investors in hedge and private-equity funds could use the provision to reduce the tax paid on rent and interest income by as much as a third.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

"Paragraph: Tens of millions more Americans will qualify for a diagnosis of high blood pressure, and will need to change their lifestyles or take medicines for the condition, under new medical guidelines released on Monday."
"Paragraph: The guidelines, formulated by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, sharply lower the threshold for normal blood pressure, in effect moving the goal posts for patients nationwide."
"Paragraph: The new criteria, the first official diagnostic revision since 2003, result from growing evidence that blood pressure far lower than once was considered normal reduces the chances of heart attack and stroke, and lowers the risk of death."
"Paragraph: New research indicates this is true even among older people for whom intensive treatment had been thought too risky."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: Now, high blood pressure, or hypertension, will be defined as 130/80 millimeters of mercury or greater for anyone with a significant risk of heart attack or stroke. By those criteria, nearly half of all American adults, and nearly 80 percent of those aged 65 and older, will need to take steps to reduce their blood pressure."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: The number of Americans with high blood pressure, or hypertension, will rise to 103 million from 72 million under the previous standard, according to Dr. Robert M. Carey, professor of medicine at the University of Virginia and co-chair of the committee writing the new guidelines."
"Paragraph: The number of men under age 45 with a diagnosis of high blood pressure will triple. The prevalence of high blood pressure among women under age 45 will double."
"Paragraph: Only those at highest risk, an additional 4.2 million people, will need drug therapy, said Dr. Carey."
"Paragraph: “Those numbers are scary, except we recommend lifestyle changes for the vast majority,” he said."
"Paragraph: The previous guidelines defined high blood pressure as 140/90. (The first number describes the pressure on blood vessels when the heart contracts, and the second refers to the pressure as the heart relaxes between beats.)"

"Paragraph: Even under that relatively more lenient standard, close to half of patients did not meet blood pressure goals, said Dr. Eric Peterson, a professor of medicine at Duke University."
"Paragraph: “A lot of it is inertia,” he said. “We accept higher blood pressures way more than we should.”"
"Paragraph: But few risk factors are as important to health. High blood pressure is second only to smoking as a preventable cause of heart attacks and strokes, and heart disease remains the leading killer of Americans."
"Paragraph: “If the guidelines are implemented, they will have a big impact,” said Dr. David Goff, director of the division of cardiovascular sciences at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: The guidelines suggest starting drug treatment with the aim of getting blood pressure below 130/80 for anyone with at least a 10 percent risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next decade. Simply being age 65 or older qualifies as such a risk if their blood pressure is higher than the new standard."
"Paragraph: Younger patients at risk include those with conditions like established heart disease or diabetes. The new standard will apply to them, as well."
"Paragraph: People whose risk of heart attack or stroke is less than 10 percent will be told to aim for blood pressure below 140/90, and to take medications if necessary to do so."
"Paragraph: If there is any good news for patients here, it is that nearly all the drugs used to treat high blood pressure are generic now. Many cost pennies a day, and most people can take them without incident."

"Paragraph: The debate over taxing sugary drinks has turned into a ferocious global policy brawl. In Colombia, proponents faced intimidation and censorship."
"Paragraph: By ANDREW JACOBS and MATT RICHTELNOV. 13, 2017\n"
"Paragraph: BOGOTÁ, Colombia — It began with menacing phone calls, strange malfunctions of the office computers, and men in parked cars photographing the entrance to the small consumer advocacy group’s offices."
"Paragraph: Then at dusk one day last December, Dr. Esperanza Cerón, the head of the organization, said she noticed two strange men on motorcycles trailing her Chevy sedan as she headed home from work. She tried to lose them in Bogotá’s rush-hour traffic, but they edged up to her car and pounded on the windows."
"Paragraph: “If you don’t keep your mouth shut,” one man shouted, she recalled in a recent interview, “you know what the consequences will be.”"
"Paragraph: The episode, which Dr. Cerón reported to federal investigators, was reminiscent of the intimidation often used against those who challenged the drug cartels that once dominated Colombia. But the narcotics trade was not the target of Dr. Cerón and her colleagues. Their work had upset a different multibillion-dollar industry: the makers of soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: Their organization, Educar Consumidores, was the most visible proponent of a proposed 20 percent tax on sugary drinks that was heading for a vote that month in Colombia’s Legislature. The group had raised money, rallied allies to the cause and produced a provocative television ad that warned consumers how sugar-laden beverages can lead to obesity and diet-related illnesses like diabetes."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: The backlash was fierce. A Colombian government agency, responding to a complaint by the nation’s leading soda company that called the ad misleading, ordered it off the air. Then the agency went further: It prohibited Dr. Cerón and her colleagues from publicly discussing the health risks of sugar, under penalty of a $250,000 fine."
"Paragraph: The battle over taxing sugar-sweetened beverages is becoming one of the world’s most ferocious policy brawls — a clash of science, politics and money in dozens of countries and cities."
"Paragraph: “The industry sees sugary-drink taxes as an existential threat,” said Dr. James Krieger, executive director of Healthy Food America, which tracks beverage tax initiatives. In the United States, the industry has spent at least $107 million at the state and local levels since 2009 to beat back soda taxes and beverage warning labels, a new study found. Compared to the domestic tactics, Dr. Krieger said, overseas, “it’s much dirtier, much more bare-knuckled.”"
"Paragraph: The harassment of Dr. Cerón and her colleagues was never proven to be carried out by the industry, and federal prosecutors declined to investigate. In response to questions from The New York Times, Coke and Pepsi said they were not involved, and Postobón, the soda company that filed the complaint about the organization’s ad, deferred comment to The National Business Association of Colombia. The association, which represented national and international beverage makers on the soda tax issue, said it had nothing to do with the episodes."
"Paragraph: The International Council of Beverages Associations, the parent organization of trade groups around the world fighting the taxes, would not directly answer the question about whether its allies in Colombia were connected to the alleged harassment, but it condemned such actions."
"Paragraph: “We reject under any circumstance the improper influence or harassment of any individual or organization for any purpose, at any time, in any way,” Katherine W. Loatman, executive director of the organization, said in a statement."
"Paragraph: The experience in Colombia may be the most extreme, but a juggernaut of industry opposition has killed or stalled soda tax proposals around the globe, including in Russia, Germany, Israel and New Zealand."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: Nevertheless, the idea is gaining momentum; such levies have been enacted in 30 countries, including India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, Britain and Brunei. More than a billion people now live in places where such taxes have driven up the price of sugar-sweetened beverages."
"Paragraph: The battles have been particularly intense in emerging markets as the industry seeks to make up for falling soda consumption in wealthier nations. Latin America has surpassed the United States as the world’s biggest soft-drink market, according to the World Health Organization, with sales of carbonated soft drinks doubling there since 2000 while they declined in the United States."
"Paragraph: The beverage industry asserts that soda taxes unfairly burden the poor, cause higher unemployment by squeezing industry sales, and fail to achieve their policy goal: reducing obesity. Studies of soda taxes have shown they lead to a drop in sales of sugar-sweetened beverages — a 10 percent sales decline, for example, over the first two years of Mexico’s tax — however, such measures are so new that there is not yet evidence of their impact on health."
"Paragraph: “Slapping a tax on our products and walking away won’t do anything about obesity in this country or globally,” said William Dermody, spokesman for the American Beverage Association, an industry trade group."
"Paragraph: But public health organizations, including the W.H.O., cite soda taxes as one of the most effective policy tools for cutting consumption of what nutritionists call a “liquid candy” that has contributed to an epidemic of obesity and related health conditions around the world. Dr. Kathryn Backholer, an expert on the issue at Deakin University in Australia, said taxes on soda were “low-hanging fruit” in the fight against obesity, diabetes and other weight-related diseases because such drinks are easily categorized to tax and sensible to target because they “have little or no nutritional value.”"
"Paragraph: Dr. Backholer and other experts said the turning point for soda tax proponents came in 2014, when Mexico — Coca-Cola’s biggest consumer market by per capita consumption — approved a 10 percent tax."
"Paragraph: Mexico also showcased how dirty the fight could get."
"Paragraph: Last year, numerous advocates of a proposal to double Mexico’s tax to 20 percent received strings of upsetting and fraudulent texts from unknown numbers. One man got a message saying his daughter had been seriously injured; another found a text saying his wife was having an affair; a third received a link to a funeral home. Spyware was found on the phones. The proposal failed."
"Paragraph: "
"Paragraph: Elsewhere in the world, soda companies have assiduously worked their government connections and economic clout. In internal company emails leaked to an American watchdog group last year, Coke executives described strategies for winning over government ministers and other officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, Portugal, and regions of Spain."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: The Australian Beverages Council wrote in its 2016 annual report that fighting a soft drinks tax “has been consuming vast amounts of resources,” and that “our learnings from other markets through our international network tells us that these types of threats must be constantly challenged before they get before a parliament for debate.”"
"Paragraph: In Colombia, where soda is often cheaper than bottled water, the soda-tax fight took place in a key market for beverage makers. Sales volume of carbonated drinks here has climbed more than 25 percent over the past 15 years; during that same time in the United States, it fell 12 percent, according to Euromonitor, a market research firm."
"Paragraph: Coke and Pepsi were far less visible in the Colombia battle, leaving the big national beverage company, Postobón, in the spotlight. Postobón, a drinks maker and distributor for Pepsi, is part of a huge conglomerate that includes sugar cane growers, sugar mills and the country’s biggest media company, RCN Televisión, which helped disseminate the anti-tax message. Postobón and RCN declined interview requests."
"Paragraph: The stage was set for a clash between a powerful industry and a stubborn public advocate."
"Paragraph: In early 2016, Colombia, a nation of 49 million, was facing the unfamiliar prospect of stability and peace. After decades of civil war and narco-terrorism, Colombians were enjoying the fruits of an aggressive United States-backed military campaign that had largely decimated the country’s drug cartels. Unemployment was near historic lows, the poverty rate was dropping and millions were hopeful about the possibility of lasting peace with the country’s main rebel group, the FARC."
"Paragraph: In March 2016, the country’s health minister, Alejandro Gaviria Uribe, proposed a 20 percent tax on soda and sugar-sweetened beverages — the equivalent of about 10 cents on a liter bottle — that became part of a larger tax overhaul backed by Colombia’s president and the Ministry of Finance."
"Paragraph: “For the first time in our lives, we thought we might become a normal country and be able to deal with issues other than violence,” said Diana Guarnizo, a lawyer with Dejusticia, a rights group that helped promote the soda tax. “Here we were, an organization that had dealt with peace, violence, land reform and gross injustice, and suddenly we had the luxury to talk about what mothers are putting in their children’s lunchboxes.”"
"Paragraph: The measure was designed to inject $340 million a year into Colombia’s chronically underfunded national health care system, but Mr. Gaviria had a larger goal: to dampen soda consumption in a country with an obesity rate that had tripled since 1980 to 19 percent of adults. The fastest growth had occurred among Colombian youth from ages 5 to 17. Each year, 4,000 people age 30 to 70 die from obesity-related illnesses like heart disease and diabetes, the Health Ministry said."
"Paragraph: The issue attracted the attention of Dr. Cerón, whose 10-employee organization had previously worked on climate change, smoking restrictions and the lack of potable water in poor communities. Encouraged by the health minister’s soda tax announcement, they formed a coalition of three dozen civic organizations they called the Alliance for Food Health."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: They received crucial support from Bloomberg Philanthropies, a foundation created by the former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, which dispatched experts from the United States. It also provided pivotal funding, including $260,000 for the public service ad — an amount nearly equal to Educar’s entire annual budget — and paid for enhanced security at the group’s offices."
"Paragraph: Opinion polls showed that 70 percent of the public embraced the tax. Legislative backing was harder to come by, however: 42 legislators in the 268-seat Congress said they supported the measure."
"Paragraph: The debate escalated in August, with Congress still months from a vote, when television stations across the country began airing a public service announcement in support of the tax. The 30-second spot, produced by Dr. Cerón’s group, used data from the W.H.O. and featured a smartly dressed man drinking a series of sugary beverages throughout the day. Four sweetened drinks a day, the ad said, could deliver up to 47 teaspoons of sugar. Then it showed an overweight couple, a gangrenous foot and what appeared to be a man in cardiac arrest, followed by an admonition. “Better to drink water, milk or teas without sugar,” the narrator said. “Take care of your life. Take it seriously.”"
"Paragraph: Postobón, the soft drink company, promptly filed a complaint with the government’s consumer protection agency, the Superintendent of Industry and Commerce, claiming the ad’s use of the teaspoon as a unit of measurement was imprecise and that it unfairly suggested that all sweetened drinks were unhealthy."
"Paragraph: Nutrition experts countered that the ad was wholly consistent with established science showing the impact of excess sugar consumption on weight and metabolic diseases like diabetes, gout and heart disease. The Harvard School of Public Health has chronicled multiple studies backing up this assertion, including a point nutritionists make repeatedly: that sugary beverages lack nutritional value and add calories without leaving consumers feeling full."
"Paragraph: Dr. Luis Fernando Gómez, a professor of preventive medicine at Javeriana University in Bogotá who backed the tax measure, said Postobón’s allegations about the commercial were disingenuous. “Every fact and figure cited in that ad was backed up by mainstream science,” he said."
"Paragraph: But the head of the Colombian consumer protection agency, a presidential appointee, sided with the industry petitioners. Just two weeks later, in a decision that Colombian legal experts described as unusually swift, the agency ordered the commercial withdrawn."
"Paragraph: Borrowing almost identical language from Postobón’s complaint — which had been filed by a company lawyer who had previously led the agency — the superintendent’s office said consumers had the right to truthful information, not messages that were “misleading, imprecise and confusing.”"
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: The ruling went on to bar Educar Consumidores employees from speaking publicly about the links between sugar and obesity, an edict so sweeping it included the Health Ministry’s own research on the subject."
"Paragraph: The consumer agency did not respond to requests for comment."
"Paragraph: The actions stunned legal analysts and health advocates. “It was unprecedented,” said Ch’uya H. Lane, regional director for obesity prevention efforts at Bloomberg’s Global Health Advocacy Incubator."
"Paragraph: “We were completely shut down,” Dr. Cerón said. “Censored.”"
"Paragraph: Postobón is a unit of one of Colombia’s largest and most respected conglomerates, Organización Ardila Lülle.

Article Content: The debate over taxing sugary drinks has turned into a ferocious global policy brawl. In Colombia, proponents faced intimidation and censorship.By ANDREW JACOBS and MATT RICHTELNOV. 13, 2017
BOGOTÁ, Colombia — It began with menacing phone calls, strange malfunctions of the office computers, and men in parked cars photographing the entrance to the small consumer advocacy group’s offices.Then at dusk one day last December, Dr. Esperanza Cerón, the head of the organization, said she noticed two strange men on motorcycles trailing her Chevy sedan as she headed home from work. She tried to lose them in Bogotá’s rush-hour traffic, but they edged up to her car and pounded on the windows.“If you don’t keep your mouth shut,” one man shouted, she recalled in a recent interview, “you know what the consequences will be.”The episode, which Dr. Cerón reported to federal investigators, was reminiscent of the intimidation often used against those who challenged the drug cartels that once dominated Colombia. But the narcotics trade was not the target of Dr. Cerón and her colleagues. Their work had upset a different multibillion-dollar industry: the makers of soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages.AdvertisementTheir organization, Educar Consumidores, was the most visible proponent of a proposed 20 percent tax on sugary drinks that was heading for a vote that month in Colombia’s Legislature. The group had raised money, rallied allies to the cause and produced a provocative television ad that warned consumers how sugar-laden beverages can lead to obesity and diet-related illnesses like diabetes.AdvertisementThe backlash was fierce. A Colombian government agency, responding to a complaint by the nation’s leading soda company that called the ad misleading, ordered it off the air. Then the agency went further: It prohibited Dr. Cerón and her colleagues from publicly discussing the health risks of sugar, under penalty of a $250,000 fine.The battle over taxing sugar-sweetened beverages is becoming one of the world’s most ferocious policy brawls — a clash of science, politics and money in dozens of countries and cities.“The industry sees sugary-drink taxes as an existential threat,” said Dr. James Krieger, executive director of Healthy Food America, which tracks beverage tax initiatives. In the United States, the industry has spent at least $107 million at the state and local levels since 2009 to beat back soda taxes and beverage warning labels, a new study found. Compared to the domestic tactics, Dr. Krieger said, overseas, “it’s much dirtier, much more bare-knuckled.”The harassment of Dr. Cerón and her colleagues was never proven to be carried out by the industry, and federal prosecutors declined to investigate. In response to questions from The New York Times, Coke and Pepsi said they were not involved, and Postobón, the soda company that filed the complaint about the organization’s ad, deferred comment to The National Business Association of Colombia. The association, which represented national and international beverage makers on the soda tax issue, said it had nothing to do with the episodes.The International Council of Beverages Associations, the parent organization of trade groups around the world fighting the taxes, would not directly answer the question about whether its allies in Colombia were connected to the alleged harassment, but it condemned such actions.“We reject under any circumstance the improper influence or harassment of any individual or organization for any purpose, at any time, in any way,” Katherine W. Loatman, executive director of the organization, said in a statement.The experience in Colombia may be the most extreme, but a juggernaut of industry opposition has killed or stalled soda tax proposals around the globe, including in Russia, Germany, Israel and New Zealand.AdvertisementNevertheless, the idea is gaining momentum; such levies have been enacted in 30 countries, including India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, Britain and Brunei. More than a billion people now live in places where such taxes have driven up the price of sugar-sweetened beverages.The battles have been particularly intense in emerging markets as the industry seeks to make up for falling soda consumption in wealthier nations. Latin America has surpassed the United States as the world’s biggest soft-drink market, according to the World Health Organization, with sales of carbonated soft drinks doubling there since 2000 while they declined in the United States.The beverage industry asserts that soda taxes unfairly burden the poor, cause higher unemployment by squeezing industry sales, and fail to achieve their policy goal: reducing obesity. Studies of soda taxes have shown they lead to a drop in sales of sugar-sweetened beverages — a 10 percent sales decline, for example, over the first two years of Mexico’s tax — however, such measures are so new that there is not yet evidence of their impact on health.“Slapping a tax on our products and walking away won’t do anything about obesity in this country or globally,” said William Dermody, spokesman for the American Beverage Association, an industry trade group.But public health organizations, including the W.H.O., cite soda taxes as one of the most effective policy tools for cutting consumption of what nutritionists call a “liquid candy” that has contributed to an epidemic of obesity and related health conditions around the world. Dr. Kathryn Backholer, an expert on the issue at Deakin University in Australia, said taxes on soda were “low-hanging fruit” in the fight against obesity, diabetes and other weight-related diseases because such drinks are easily categorized to tax and sensible to target because they “have little or no nutritional value.”Dr. Backholer and other experts said the turning point for soda tax proponents came in 2014, when Mexico — Coca-Cola’s biggest consumer market by per capita consumption — approved a 10 percent tax.Mexico also showcased how dirty the fight could get.Last year, numerous advocates of a proposal to double Mexico’s tax to 20 percent received strings of upsetting and fraudulent texts from unknown numbers. One man got a message saying his daughter had been seriously injured; another found a text saying his wife was having an affair; a third received a link to a funeral home. Spyware was found on the phones. The proposal failed.Elsewhere in the world, soda companies have assiduously worked their government connections and economic clout. In internal company emails leaked to an American watchdog group last year, Coke executives described strategies for winning over government ministers and other officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, Portugal, and regions of Spain.AdvertisementThe Australian Beverages Council wrote in its 2016 annual report that fighting a soft drinks tax “has been consuming vast amounts of resources,” and that “our learnings from other markets through our international network tells us that these types of threats must be constantly challenged before they get before a parliament for debate.”In Colombia, where soda is often cheaper than bottled water, the soda-tax fight took place in a key market for beverage makers. Sales volume of carbonated drinks here has climbed more than 25 percent over the past 15 years; during that same time in the United States, it fell 12 percent, according to Euromonitor, a market research firm.Coke and Pepsi were far less visible in the Colombia battle, leaving the big national beverage company, Postobón, in the spotlight. Postobón, a drinks maker and distributor for Pepsi, is part of a huge conglomerate that includes sugar cane growers, sugar mills and the country’s biggest media company, RCN Televisión, which helped disseminate the anti-tax message. Postobón and RCN declined interview requests.The stage was set for a clash between a powerful industry and a stubborn public advocate.In early 2016, Colombia, a nation of 49 million, was facing the unfamiliar prospect of stability and peace. After decades of civil war and narco-terrorism, Colombians were enjoying the fruits of an aggressive United States-backed military campaign that had largely decimated the country’s drug cartels. Unemployment was near historic lows, the poverty rate was dropping and millions were hopeful about the possibility of lasting peace with the country’s main rebel group, the FARC.In March 2016, the country’s health minister, Alejandro Gaviria Uribe, proposed a 20 percent tax on soda and sugar-sweetened beverages — the equivalent of about 10 cents on a liter bottle — that became part of a larger tax overhaul backed by Colombia’s president and the Ministry of Finance.“For the first time in our lives, we thought we might become a normal country and be able to deal with issues other than violence,” said Diana Guarnizo, a lawyer with Dejusticia, a rights group that helped promote the soda tax. “Here we were, an organization that had dealt with peace, violence, land reform and gross injustice, and suddenly we had the luxury to talk about what mothers are putting in their children’s lunchboxes.”The measure was designed to inject $340 million a year into Colombia’s chronically underfunded national health care system, but Mr. Gaviria had a larger goal: to dampen soda consumption in a country with an obesity rate that had tripled since 1980 to 19 percent of adults. The fastest growth had occurred among Colombian youth from ages 5 to 17. Each year, 4,000 people age 30 to 70 die from obesity-related illnesses like heart disease and diabetes, the Health Ministry said.The issue attracted the attention of Dr. Cerón, whose 10-employee organization had previously worked on climate change, smoking restrictions and the lack of potable water in poor communities. Encouraged by the health minister’s soda tax announcement, they formed a coalition of three dozen civic organizations they called the Alliance for Food Health.AdvertisementThey received crucial support from Bloomberg Philanthropies, a foundation created by the former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, which dispatched experts from the United States. It also provided pivotal funding, including $260,000 for the public service ad — an amount nearly equal to Educar’s entire annual budget — and paid for enhanced security at the group’s offices.Opinion polls showed that 70 percent of the public embraced the tax. Legislative backing was harder to come by, however: 42 legislators in the 268-seat Congress said they supported the measure.The debate escalated in August, with Congress still months from a vote, when television stations across the country began airing a public service announcement in support of the tax. The 30-second spot, produced by Dr. Cerón’s group, used data from the W.H.O. and featured a smartly dressed man drinking a series of sugary beverages throughout the day. Four sweetened drinks a day, the ad said, could deliver up to 47 teaspoons of sugar. Then it showed an overweight couple, a gangrenous foot and what appeared to be a man in cardiac arrest, followed by an admonition. “Better to drink water, milk or teas without sugar,” the narrator said. “Take care of your life. Take it seriously.”Postobón, the soft drink company, promptly filed a complaint with the government’s consumer protection agency, the Superintendent of Industry and Commerce, claiming the ad’s use of the teaspoon as a unit of measurement was imprecise and that it unfairly suggested that all sweetened drinks were unhealthy.Nutrition experts countered that the ad was wholly consistent with established science showing the impact of excess sugar consumption on weight and metabolic diseases like diabetes, gout and heart disease. The Harvard School of Public Health has chronicled multiple studies backing up this assertion, including a point nutritionists make repeatedly: that sugary beverages lack nutritional value and add calories without leaving consumers feeling full.Dr. Luis Fernando Gómez, a professor of preventive medicine at Javeriana University in Bogotá who backed the tax measure, said Postobón’s allegations about the commercial were disingenuous. “Every fact and figure cited in that ad was backed up by mainstream science,” he said.But the head of the Colombian consumer protection agency, a presidential appointee, sided with the industry petitioners. Just two weeks later, in a decision that Colombian legal experts described as unusually swift, the agency ordered the commercial withdrawn.Borrowing almost identical language from Postobón’s complaint — which had been filed by a company lawyer who had previously led the agency — the superintendent’s office said consumers had the right to truthful information, not messages that were “misleading, imprecise and confusing.”AdvertisementThe ruling went on to bar Educar Consumidores employees from speaking publicly about the links between sugar and obesity, an edict so sweeping it included the Health Ministry’s own research on the subject.The consumer agency did not respond to requests for comment.The actions stunned legal analysts and health advocates. “It was unprecedented,” said Ch’uya H. Lane, regional director for obesity prevention efforts at Bloomberg’s Global Health Advocacy Incubator.“We were completely shut down,” Dr. Cerón said. “Censored.”Postobón is a unit of one of Colombia’s largest and most respected conglomerates, Organización Ardila Lülle. Founded in the early 1950s by Carlos Ardila Lülle, 87, Organización Ardila Lülle has helped define the country’s modern identity through a raft of companies that own a soccer team, an insurance company and the dealerships that sell Dodge, Jeep and Ford vehicles.Postobón is a storied brand that sells a rainbow of homegrown drinks. Among its best-known products are a cola called Colombiana and Manzana Postobón, a century-old apple-flavored drink that is something of a national icon.Organización Ardila Lülle remained silent during the soda-tax debate, and company executives declined to be interviewed. Instead, Postobón, RCN and allies like the National Business Association of Colombia carried the message that the tax would cost jobs, decimate independent convenience shop owners and choke the economy.“In Colombia, the sugar industry and the main media companies belong to the same economic conglomerates,” Mr. Gaviria, the health minister, said. “They have an intimidating power. And they used it.”That fall, at least 90 lobbyists worked to sway legislators, according to a tally of visitor logs provided by Bloomberg Philanthropies. During committee hearings on the measure, lobbyists often sat next to lawmakers, a flagrant violation of Congressional rules, said Óscar Ospina Quintero, a legislator from the Green Alliance party.

"Paragraph: TEHRAN — Iranians dug through rubble in a frantic search for survivors on Monday, after a powerful earthquake struck near the Iraqi border, killing more than 450 people and injuring thousands of others in the world’s deadliest earthquake so far this year."
"Paragraph: The quake, recorded at 9:18 p.m. on Sunday, was felt as far away as Turkey and Pakistan. The epicenter was near Ezgeleh, Iran, about 135 miles northeast of Baghdad, and had a preliminary magnitude of 7.3, according to the United States Geological Survey. Seismologists in the country said it was the biggest quake to hit the western part of Iran."
"Paragraph: A 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck the area Sunday evening. More than 400 are dead and thousands injured."
"Paragraph: Photographs from the region — a patchwork of farms and home to many Kurds, a large ethnic minority in Iran — posted on the internet showed collapsed buildings, cars destroyed by rubble and people sleeping in the streets in fear of aftershocks."
"Paragraph: At least 445 people were killed and 7,370 people were injured in Iran, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency, which gave an estimate significantly higher than the death toll of 407 that officials had announced earlier."
"Paragraph: At least eight people were killed on the Iraqi side of the border, according to Dr. Saif al-Badir, a spokesman for the Health Ministry, and at least 535 were hurt."

"Paragraph: In Tehran, hundreds of people waited in line to donate blood in response to a call from the government. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, delivered a message of condolence on Monday, urging rescue workers to keep searching for survivors."
"Paragraph: “The officials should hasten in these first hours with all their might and determination to help the injured, especially those trapped under the rubble,” his office reported."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: By the evening, however, Iranian officials said that the rescue mission was nearly over, according to the state news media."
"Paragraph: Particularly hard hit was Pol-e Zahab, a city in the western Iranian province of Kermanshah, according to the semiofficial Iranian Students News Agency. The authorities said that at least 236 people had died in the city, which has a population of 30,000, and the main hospital was believed to be at least partly running."
"Paragraph: “My friend was screaming, saying, ‘I lost my home,’ ” one resident wrote on Twitter. “Thank God, she and her family are doing well. She said people were only mourning and their loved ones were under the rubble.”"
"Paragraph: One image from Pol-e Zahab appeared to show the near-destruction of an apartment block recently built for low-income families. Another, posted on the website Khabar Online, showed a pickup truck transporting victims under colorful blankets."
"Paragraph: Farhad Tarji, a member of Parliament for Pol-e Zahab, told the semiofficial news agency ILNA that his family had been devastated by the quake. “I’ve lost 15 people,” he said."
"Paragraph: The Iranian government newspaper posted a video on its website in which a resident of Pol-e Zahab complained that no aid had come."

"Paragraph: “There has been no help yet, neither food nor water, no clothing, no tents, there is nothing,” said the resident, a man who appeared to be in his 30s, while standing in a street with collapsed buildings. “There are no facilities yet. We’ve slept outside since last night. This is the condition of our homes. Our electricity, water, gas, phone lines are out, everything is completely out, the whole city has been destroyed, it is wrecked.”"
"Paragraph: An image posted on social media showed soldiers searching through the rubble at night without flashlights or torches, using their cellphones for light."
"Paragraph: Officials from the Health Ministry traveled to the area, as did the commander-in-chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, Brig. Gen. Mohammed Ali Jafari, but foreign reporters were not allowed to visit the scene, in a change from previous disasters."
"Paragraph: The Iranian Red Crescent used rescue dogs to search for survivors, as it has since an earthquake in the southern city of Bam in 2003 that killed more than 20,000 people. The country’s religious leaders regard dogs as unclean, but the use of guard and rescue dogs is accepted."
"Paragraph: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was president of Iran from 2005 to 2013, introduced a program to build low-income housing, including in Pol-e Zahab. After the quake on Sunday, his political opponents said that many of the buildings had been poorly constructed, but his defenders said that the buildings were on fault lines, and that nothing could have been done."
"Paragraph: Initial reports from the Kurdish region of Iraq indicated less damage and fewer deaths on that side of the border. In Sulaimaniya, the second-largest city in Iraq’s Kurdish region, residents described feeling heavy tremors but said there was no notable building damage. Residents in the oil-rich town of Kirkuk, roughly 50 miles to the west, reported similar damage."
"Paragraph: Ali Namiq, a resident of the town Darbandikhan, Iraq, said a building was flattened by the quake. “The building fell on a seven-member family,” he told Reuters. “We managed to rescue only five out of them, while the two others were killed. It was the first time for me to see an earthquake. It is a divine act that no one can prevent.”"
"Paragraph: In the town of Kalar, Iraq, the quake sent items tumbling from shelves in a supermarket, causing shoppers to flee."

"Paragraph: The quake occurred about 20 miles south of the Iraqi city of Halabja, where Saddam Hussein’s government launched a poison gas attack that killed more than 5,000 people, mostly Kurds, on March 16, 1988, in the closing days of the Iran-Iraq war."
"Paragraph: The earthquake was felt as far as the Mediterranean coast of Israel. Shiite pilgrims in the Iraqi city of Karbala, for the annual religious commemoration of Arba’een, posted videos of people gathering on the streets after the earthquake."
"Paragraph: Iran lies on dozens of fault lines and is prone to quakes. In 2012, a double earthquake in the north of the country killed 300 people. When residents learned of the government’s lackluster relief efforts,  some started organizing aid groups themselves. After that quake, the United States, which does not maintain normal diplomatic relations with Iran, sent several planeloads of aid."

"Paragraph: By ERIC KLINENBERGNOV. 13, 2017\n"
"Paragraph: Early last month, President Trump visited Puerto Rico on a trip designed to signal the federal government’s recognition of the unfolding catastrophe from Hurricane Maria. When the hurricane crashed into Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, it cut off electricity to nearly all of the island’s 3.4 million residents, destroyed 80 percent of the agricultural supply, knocked out cellular phone service, blocked roads, decimated homes and left at least 1.7 million people without potable water."
"Paragraph: Such extensive breakdowns in what engineers call “lifeline systems” would have been devastating in any American state or city. Puerto Rico, a bankrupt commonwealth where nearly half of all residents live below the poverty line and some 650,000 are age 65 or older, was especially vulnerable."
"Paragraph: But instead of pledging support for a large-scale emergency relief plan, Mr. Trump declared that Hurricane Maria was not a “real catastrophe” and complained that the storm had “thrown our budget a little out of whack.” He announced that the official death toll from the hurricane, merely 16 at the time, was the true measure of the government’s response. “We saved a lot of lives,” he boasted, and then flew back home."
"Paragraph: The statements were stunningly tone deaf. Morgues and funeral homes were calling for help dealing with the bodies piling up around their facilities. Scores of people who lived and died alone were sure to be discovered when roads reopened. Nearly everyone, regardless of class or status, was stranded, suffering and afraid. But federal officials, following Mr. Trump’s lead, continued to insist that the mortality level was minuscule."
"Paragraph: Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world."

"Paragraph: View all New York Times newsletters."
"Paragraph: Now that narrative has collapsed. On Thursday, Puerto Rican officials announced that 472 more people died there in September 2017 than in September 2016. That figure, which epidemiologists call the excess death toll, is a more reliable measure of the disaster’s human impact than the initial figure of 16 that Mr. Trump cited, because it includes cases that medical examiners could not process in the immediate aftermath of the storm."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: In theory, it’s possible that the excess death toll will go down when October’s mortality statistics come in; perhaps Hurricane Maria killed mostly people who would have lived only a few weeks or months anyway. But the record from similar disasters suggests that this is unlikely. It’s far more likely that Puerto Rico experienced another spike in deaths during October, when, thanks to Mr. Trump’s refusal to support a major federal relief effort, power, water and food remained in short supply."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: Counting the deaths from disasters is often politically contentious, and Mr. Trump is hardly the first public official who has been quick to underestimate the toll. In July 1995, Chicago endured a devastating heat wave. As in Puerto Rico, hundreds of bodies piled up at the morgue, and the medical examiner warned that the city would soon discover hundreds more in private homes. But rather than declare a heat emergency, Mayor Richard M. Daley questioned this scientific accounting. “Every day people die of natural causes,” he insisted. “You cannot claim that everybody who has died in the last eight or nine days dies of heat.”"
"Paragraph: Mr. Daley’s public relations strategy led to a failed public health response. Ultimately, epidemiologists confirmed that 739 people in excess of the norm died during the week of the disaster. How many lives might the city have saved had it immediately acknowledged the crisis and thrown all its resources into an urgent response? We’ll never know."
"Paragraph: Unlike the 1995 Chicago heat wave, Hurricane Maria is a continuing disaster. At this point, it’s clear that there is nothing natural about the mounting public health crisis and that the federal government is compounding the problem through malign neglect. Puerto Rico urgently needs a sweeping infrastructure rebuilding project — not only to restore its power, water and communications systems, but also to prepare it for the next set of extreme weather events that our ever-warming world will doubtless deliver."
"Paragraph: On his visit to Puerto Rico, Mr. Trump witnessed the physical devastation and human suffering in person. He extended his hand, not to help those in need, but rather to pat himself on the back. Every day since then, he and Congress have chosen to ignore the carnage in Puerto Rico. Some of that blood is on their hands."
"Paragraph: Eric Klinenberg (@ericklinenberg), a professor of sociology and the director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University, is the author of “Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago.”"

"Paragraph: Dear Chairman Kim Jong-un,"
"Paragraph: We are certain that you will find this letter of love surprising."
"Paragraph: We offer it to you in the final days of President Trump’s trip to Asia, when the rhetoric of war, hatred and mass violence has reached a fever pitch. It speaks of the urgent need for mutual love between our two countries, the United States and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea."
"Paragraph: We write you as two American citizens — an African-American and a Korean-American — considered “men of color” in our own country, who have suffered with our people under the history of America’s white racist violence, yet who still dare to love. Just as we have faith in our fragile and imperfect American democratic experiment, we have faith that you believe in something far more courageous than words of war."
"Paragraph: Our aim is to meet you in the spirit of a resolute conviction that you are a human being who is worthy of being loved by us and that we are human beings worthy of being loved by you. It is quite simple, really, and yet so hard for so many to see: that we, North Koreans and Americans, are brothers and sisters. That straighforward yet existentially urgent statement is what is necessary during this time of crisis between our nations."
"Paragraph: George Yancy: We stand with our brothers and sisters in North Korea who may feel as we do, wanting to know us, possibly to love us, but who have not been given the opportunity because of your regime. Clearly, our political leaders in the United States have failed to reach across this ever growing and dangerous divide and say, “Yes, we love the people of North Korea, and we recognize the humanity of Kim Jong-un.” And of course, you and your country’s officials have failed to do this as well."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: In this letter of love, we refuse to speak of “fire and fury.” Instead, we speak of love, life and our globally shared humanity. We refuse to believe that there is “no choice”; we reject the language and morally unacceptable and inept threat to “totally destroy North Korea”; we reject the violent discourse and imagery of being “locked and loaded.” And we believe that a dialogue, especially one rooted in the language and spirit of love, is not a waste of time. Shared love is our deliverance from hatred."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: We know that love is dangerous, because it requires facing one’s own brokenness and vulnerability. Yet both of our nations are morally broken, imperfect. So we speak with the impassioned words of Mahatma Gandhi: “I offer you peace. I offer you love. I offer you friendship. I see your beauty. I hear your need. I feel your feelings.”"
"Paragraph: This letter fervently asks more from you and from the United States. The writer James Baldwin, one of our most prophetic voices, wrote: “One can give nothing whatever without giving oneself — that is to say, risking oneself. If one cannot risk oneself, then one is simply incapable of giving.” Neither of our nations has much to give the other because each has failed to risk itself. And it is out of our collective and respective cowardice — our refusal to risk, to love and to combat our mutual cynicism — that this letter of love arises. It serves as an intervention as we face the potential horrors of unspeakable mass death. We stand with our brother Martin Luther King Jr., who refused “to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway into the hell of nuclear annihilation.”"
"Paragraph: There are many here in the United States who will say that this letter is absurd, useless, even treasonous. Well, if love is treasonous, then we take joy in it. We revel in speaking out against hatred; inhumanity; divisiveness; discourse mired in immature name-calling; ugly, disparaging remarks; talk of destruction and obliteration; and the potential of miscalculation and nuclear conflagration. We prefer to stand on the “treasonous” side of Jesus, who dared to love."
"Paragraph: We are traitors to those who reject mutual respect and who believe that there is no place for love as a binding force greater than mutual bullying and provocation. We are traitors to our country’s divisive rhetoric, filled with militarism, hatred, blood lust and warmongering, just as we stand opposed to yours, which threatens not only us, but also your neighbors — that is, your own brothers and sisters, and even your own people. As men of color, we know the semblance of that threat from within our own country."
"Paragraph: To hate requires so little; to love requires doing what may feel impossible, because it means to lay down the sword and stretch out your hands, your arms, your hearts, to each other. Many will also criticize us, saying that love is too simplistic, that the problem between North Korea and the United States is too ideologically and geopolitically complicated. Those people fail to imagine with their hearts. Dr. King said: “We are inevitably our brother’s keeper because we are our brother’s brother. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.” And Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, another prophetic American voice of love, asked us, “How many disasters do we have to go through in order to realize that all of humanity has a stake in the liberty of one person; whenever one person is offended, we are all hurt.”"

"Paragraph: View all New York Times newsletters."
"Paragraph: That kind of love refuses to hate, it refuses to believe that we are “enemies” by birth. We are brothers and sisters born of a common humanity. We believe in a love that remembers the humanity that binds us together, that opens us to hear the other’s voice, the other’s mourning. Then again, perhaps Baldwin was correct, “There are too many things we do not wish to know about ourselves.” Yet we believe that reciprocal love can take us to that place together and heal our wounds."
"Paragraph: David Kyuman Kim: These feel like especially loveless times. We write from the conviction that the values of a love-driven politics can transform how we engage each other not only as nations but also as human beings. Which is to say, a love-driven politics insists that we seek compassion, generosity, kindness, forgiveness and mercy for each other as much as we do for ourselves."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: Our president was elected to represent our people, but he has not represented the best of us. He has instead chosen to display only our basest traits. While he is not the first president to speak and act with hubris and arrogance, he has chosen belligerence over diplomacy, bullying over accord, insult over care. He represents a strand and strain of the American experiment that stubbornly holds on to the misguided notion that we are a nation of destiny and superiority, strengthened on legacies of white supremacy and rapacious capitalism. He has exacted those misguided ideals by treating you with disrespect and disregard, all the while belittling you as a leader of your own people, and you, in turn have done the same."
"Paragraph: As a Korean-American, I have to acknowledge you both as one of my people and very much not of my people. My mother’s family is from North Korea, and so in some very real ways, you and I are of common stock. But a land does not make for family. If anything, you and your father have shown how land and nation can destroy families and traumatize them for generations. You are the leader of a nation whose people have suffered at the service of a political vision. At what cost has your loyalty to power come to your people, let alone to your humanity?"
"Paragraph: My mother’s family fled North Korea because of the forces of war that are all too similar to the enmities that are threatening us today. And it was the consequences of the Korean War and the havoc it wreaked on my people in South Korea that eventually drove my family to the United States. And through this migration and growing up in white-supremacist America, I was transformed from our common stock to a Korean-American dedicated to the ways of love."
"Paragraph: Indeed, as a Korean brother I have been forged by my inheritance from Christianity and Confucianism. This means that my witness to you is born of traditions of love and ethical responsibility. Among the very real and central challenges of radical love is to adhere to the moral mandate to love our neighbors and enemies as we would love ourselves.

"Paragraph: This is the tradition of radical love most powerfully and persuasively articulated and represented by Martin Luther King Jr. This is a tradition that insists that love has the power to bind us together in a common purpose, that love gives us the confidence and courage to stand up to injustice and suffering.

"Paragraph: We reach out to you from this tradition that holds the value of speaking truth to power with love. This is a calling. It is our vocation. We have no choice but to strive to live up to the examples of Dr. King and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, of activists like Fannie Lou Hamer and Grace Lee Boggs. These heroic figures have been exceptions to the insidious rule of an American legacy of white supremacy and imperialism that has left the least among us in utter despair. This tradition of radical love is an American tradition, even though it has drawn deeply and powerfully from people like Gandhi and Thich Nhat Hanh."
"Paragraph: We come to you as citizens of an America not yet fully realized, one that insists that the ways of love can be the ways of democracy, that the challenge of loving one’s neighbors and enemies is fundamentally a call for freedom and justice and hope.

                            THE STONE
                        NOV. 13, 2017
        Dear Chairman Kim Jong-un,We are certain that you will find this letter of love surprising.We offer it to you in the final days of President Trump’s trip to Asia, when the rhetoric of war, hatred and mass violence has reached a fever pitch. It speaks of the urgent need for mutual love between our two countries, the United States and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.We write you as two American citizens — an African-American and a Korean-American — considered “men of color” in our own country, who have suffered with our people under the history of America’s white racist violence, yet who still dare to love. Just as we have faith in our fragile and imperfect American democratic experiment, we have faith that you believe in something far more courageous than words of war.Our aim is to meet you in the spirit of a resolute conviction that you are a human being who is worthy of being loved by us and that we are human beings worthy of being loved by you. It is quite simple, really, and yet so hard for so many to see: that we, North Koreans and Americans, are brothers and sisters. That straighforward yet existentially urgent statement is what is necessary during this time of crisis between our nations.George Yancy: We stand with our brothers and sisters in North Korea who may feel as we do, wanting to know us, possibly to love us, but who have not been given the opportunity because of your regime. Clearly, our political leaders in the United States have failed to reach across this ever growing and dangerous divide and say, “Yes, we love the people of North Korea, and we recognize the humanity of Kim Jong-un.” And of course, you and your country’s officials have failed to do this as well.AdvertisementIn this letter of love, we refuse to speak of “fire and fury.” Instead, we speak of love, life and our globally shared humanity. We refuse to believe that there is “no choice”; we reject the language and morally unacceptable and inept threat to “totally destroy North Korea”; we reject the violent discourse and imagery of being “locked and loaded.” And we believe that a dialogue, especially one rooted in the language and spirit of love, is not a waste of time. Shared love is our deliverance from hatred.AdvertisementWe know that love is dangerous, because it requires facing one’s own brokenness and vulnerability. Yet both of our nations are morally broken, imperfect. So we speak with the impassioned words of Mahatma Gandhi: “I offer you peace. I offer you love. I offer you friendship. I see your beauty. I hear your need. I feel your feelings.”This letter fervently asks more from you and from the United States. The writer James Baldwin, one of our most prophetic voices, wrote: “One can give nothing whatever without giving oneself — that is to say, risking oneself. If one cannot risk oneself, then one is simply incapable of giving.” Neither of our nations has much to give the other because each has failed to risk itself. And it is out of our collective and respective cowardice — our refusal to risk, to love and to combat our mutual cynicism — that this letter of love arises. It serves as an intervention as we face the potential horrors of unspeakable mass death. We stand with our brother Martin Luther King Jr., who refused “to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway into the hell of nuclear annihilation.”There are many here in the United States who will say that this letter is absurd, useless, even treasonous. Well, if love is treasonous, then we take joy in it. We revel in speaking out against hatred; inhumanity; divisiveness; discourse mired in immature name-calling; ugly, disparaging remarks; talk of destruction and obliteration; and the potential of miscalculation and nuclear conflagration. We prefer to stand on the “treasonous” side of Jesus, who dared to love.We are traitors to those who reject mutual respect and who believe that there is no place for love as a binding force greater than mutual bullying and provocation. We are traitors to our country’s divisive rhetoric, filled with militarism, hatred, blood lust and warmongering, just as we stand opposed to yours, which threatens not only us, but also your neighbors — that is, your own brothers and sisters, and even your own people. As men of color, we know the semblance of that threat from within our own country.To hate requires so little; to love requires doing what may feel impossible, because it means to lay down the sword and stretch out your hands, your arms, your hearts, to each other. Many will also criticize us, saying that love is too simplistic, that the problem between North Korea and the United States is too ideologically and geopolitically complicated. Those people fail to imagine with their hearts. Dr. King said: “We are inevitably our brother’s keeper because we are our brother’s brother. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.” And Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, another prophetic American voice of love, asked us, “How many disasters do we have to go through in order to realize that all of humanity has a stake in the liberty of one person; whenever one person is offended, we are all hurt.”Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address. Please re-enter.You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.View all New York Times newsletters.That kind of love refuses to hate, it refuses to believe that we are “enemies” by birth. We are brothers and sisters born of a common humanity. We believe in a love that remembers the humanity that binds us together, that opens us to hear the other’s voice, the other’s mourning. Then again, perhaps Baldwin was correct, “There are too many things we do not wish to know about ourselves.” Yet we believe that reciprocal love can take us to that place together and heal our wounds.David Kyuman Kim: These feel like especially loveless times. We write from the conviction that the values of a love-driven politics can transform how we engage each other not only as nations but also as human beings. Which is to say, a love-driven politics insists that we seek compassion, generosity, kindness, forgiveness and mercy for each other as much as we do for ourselves.AdvertisementOur president was elected to represent our people, but he has not represented the best of us. He has instead chosen to display only our basest traits. While he is not the first president to speak and act with hubris and arrogance, he has chosen belligerence over diplomacy, bullying over accord, insult over care. He represents a strand and strain of the American experiment that stubbornly holds on to the misguided notion that we are a nation of destiny and superiority, strengthened on legacies of white supremacy and rapacious capitalism. He has exacted those misguided ideals by treating you with disrespect and disregard, all the while belittling you as a leader of your own people, and you, in turn have done the same.As a Korean-American, I have to acknowledge you both as one of my people and very much not of my people. My mother’s family is from North Korea, and so in some very real ways, you and I are of common stock. But a land does not make for family. If anything, you and your father have shown how land and nation can destroy families and traumatize them for generations. You are the leader of a nation whose people have suffered at the service of a political vision. At what cost has your loyalty to power come to your people, let alone to your humanity?My mother’s family fled North Korea because of the forces of war that are all too similar to the enmities that are threatening us today. And it was the consequences of the Korean War and the havoc it wreaked on my people in South Korea that eventually drove my family to the United States. And through this migration and growing up in white-supremacist America, I was transformed from our common stock to a Korean-American dedicated to the ways of love.Indeed, as a Korean brother I have been forged by my inheritance from Christianity and Confucianism. This means that my witness to you is born of traditions of love and ethical responsibility. Among the very real and central challenges of radical love is to adhere to the moral mandate to love our neighbors and enemies as we would love ourselves. This is especially challenging at a moment in which love has been hard to find and discern. For those of us who lament the ascendancy of our current president, we have had to learn how to love ourselves once again.We write you today not only because of what you are hearing from us — the United States — but, more important, because of all the crucial things you are not hearing.

"Paragraph: By TARIRO MZEZEWANOV. 13, 2017\n"
"Paragraph: Earlier this month, the bodies of 26 teenagers were found floating in the Mediterranean Sea. The corpses were sent to Salerno, Italy, where autopsies are being conducted to determine the details of their deaths. The girls were probably victims of sex trafficking, originally picked up in southern Nigeria, held in Libya and then sent to Italian shores in dinghies. Aid workers suspect that, like many African girls trafficked before them, they were tortured and raped."
"Paragraph: “We will see if they have family members,” Marco Rotunno, the communications officer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Italy, told me. “Most of the Nigerian girls travel alone, part of a huge trafficking network, and no one knows exactly who they are.”"
"Paragraph: We have read many terrible stories in the past few years about refugees from countries like Syria and Yemen found dead or near death at sea while making the perilous trip to Europe. Who can forget the photograph of the body of the 2-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on Turkish shores in September 2015? Within days we knew many details about this child: His name was Alan Kurdi. He was of Kurdish descent. His family was trying to reach Canada."
"Paragraph: But we have read next to nothing about the African girls who have made similar journeys. More than a week after the bodies of these 26 girls were found, we know only that they were 14 to 18 years old — nothing about the lives they led. The horrible reality is that they will most likely remain nameless, never identified or claimed."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: “When Syrian families arrive from Libya, they have been through a lot, but they haven’t faced the same kind of abuse these Nigerian girls have,” Mr. Rotunno said. When Syrians die at sea, he explained, they tend to be identified more quickly because they are with relatives or people who know them, unlike African women and girls, who typically travel alone."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: Since the 1980s, tens of thousands of girls from the area around Benin City, in southern Nigeria, have been taken to Italy, where they are forced into prostitution. Over the past three years, according to the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration, Italy has seen a nearly 600 percent increase in the number of potential sex-trafficking victims arriving by sea. Last year, 1,100 Nigerian girls made the trip; some 80 percent of them are thought to be trafficking victims."
"Paragraph: Because of its geographic centrality and proximity to Italy, Libya is a frequent way station for refugees and victims of trafficking traveling from the Middle East, sub-Saharan and East Africa to Europe. Since the country was plunged into chaos after the toppling of Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011, warring factions have taken to profiting off these vulnerable people."
"Paragraph: Conditions are terrible for all refugees, who are typically held in detention centers under the authority of the Tripoli-based government. But they are by far the worst for those with black skin."

"Paragraph: In Libyan cities, West African men and boys are bought and sold in broad daylight in modern-day slave markets. Migrants with certain skills, like tiling or painting, fetch a higher price. Women and girls are not sold in these markets because they are expected to arrive in Europe ready to work as prostitutes."
"Paragraph: Africans with darker skin are taunted and derided as “burned” by Libyan smugglers. Men are beaten and forced to work in unbearable construction jobs for no pay. Aid workers told me that they often see sub-Saharan Africans who make it to Europe or who escape Libya and try to return to their home country with burns and cuts from the torture they’ve endured. Women sometimes arrive pregnant after being raped in Libya."
"Paragraph: Those Africans who make it to Italy arrive in a country where name-calling and verbal attacks on even the most prominent black people, like politicians and athletes, is commonplace. Italians accuse Africans of stealing jobs and of all being thieves, rapists, prostitutes and drug dealers."
"Paragraph: “Here in Italy, a lot of people think Africans are coming for work, not to escape horrible situations or because they have no choice,” Mr. Rotunno said."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: Distinctions by policymakers between “economic migrants,” typically believed to be Africans, and “refugees,” like those fleeing Middle Eastern conflicts, don’t help. All people who flee their homes need help; the choice is no choice."
"Paragraph: Tens of thousands of women who have been trafficked from Benin City have remained nameless and faceless to much of the world for decades. But back home, they are known: A 2003 United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute report concluded that “virtually every Benin family has one member or the other involved in trafficking either as a victim, sponsor, madam or trafficker.”"
"Paragraph: “There’s a lot of misinformation about what opportunities are in Europe,” Federico Soda, the Mediterranean director of the United Nations migrant agency, told me. “People know there’s something better, are seeking it and taking massive risks to try and achieve it, but nobody sets out with the worst possible scenario becoming reality.”"
"Paragraph: Italian politicians often blame smugglers for migrant deaths. But in the past year, they have enacted policies that have made it much more difficult for migrants to safely reach the country. Italy has struck deals with tribesmen who control Libya’s southern border; persuaded militias to keep boats from leaving Libya for Italy; promised local Libyan leaders money to replace profits from trafficking; and led a campaign to keep nongovernmental humanitarian agencies like Doctors Without Borders from saving people in the sea — all to ensure that fewer migrants get to Europe."
"Paragraph: It’s working. Arrivals in Italy of migrants by sea have plunged from 181,000 last year to 114,000 this year. But at what cost? Policies enacted by the Italian government, many backed by the European Union, make the continent’s leaders as culpable as the traffickers who put the young women on the boats in the first place."
"Paragraph: The rest of the world should be asking ourselves why the lives of African girls and women remain so cheap. Within days of the 26 bodies being found, Mr. Rotunno told me, 13 others were discovered in the Mediterranean, including that of a 3-year-old. That news didn’t make any headlines."

"Paragraph: By CINDY OTIS, NED PRICE and JOHN SIPHERNOV. 13, 2017\n"
"Paragraph: President Trump reignited controversy about Russia recently by declaring he believes that its president, Vladimir Putin, is sincere when he asserts that Moscow did not interfere in last year’s presidential election. The director of the C.I.A., Mike Pompeo, made similarly confounding remarks last month when he said that Russia’s campaign had failed to affect the outcome of the election, misrepresenting the formal judgment of the intelligence community. A C.I.A. spokesman later said that Mr. Pompeo had misspoken."
"Paragraph: As former C.I.A. officers, we find both of those comments deeply troubling. But another, less noticed remark by Mr. Pompeo was equally disturbing. He said that agency officers have an obligation to remain quiet about their work for a period that “far extends beyond the day you turn in your badge.” Even if his ire was trained primarily at specific outspoken former intelligence community leaders, his message to all former C.I.A. officers was clear: Stop speaking out."
"Paragraph: Our response to him is this: Respectfully, we won’t. As former C.I.A. officers, we would like to explain why we have decided to speak out about the troubling state of our country’s leadership and the dangerous implications for our national security."
"Paragraph: Two of us served as analysts focused on counterterrorism and broader security issues, while another of us was an operations officer for nearly three decades. Each of us served under presidents of both parties, and we all left the C.I.A. at different times and for different reasons. We fall on various points of the political spectrum, but at least one element unites us: We joined the C.I.A. because of our love of country and desire to protect the ideals upon which it was founded."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: On our first day at C.I.A. headquarters, we raised our right hands and declared that we would protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Nowhere in that oath — or any of the reams of paperwork we signed — did we pledge to defend a specific president or a particular political party. Our loyalty oath was to something far greater, and that oath is the very reason we have chosen to be vocal."

"Paragraph: Indeed, we believe we have a responsibility to call out when our leadership is not doing enough to keep America safe. We are most alarmed by the current administration’s continued denial of Russian interference in the presidential election, despite the high confidence judgment of the intelligence community to the contrary. In the most recent episode, President Trump has equivocated as to whom he believes: his own intelligence agencies or Mr. Putin, a retired K.G.B. colonel. It was only after a public outcry that President Trump, seemingly begrudgingly, cast his lot with American intelligence agencies, at least for the time being."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: Indeed, the intelligence community assessment was emphatic: Russia carried out an aggressive covert influence campaign, including cyberoperations, to give Mr. Trump an advantage and to undermine public faith in our democratic process. This was not the run-of-the-mill Russian meddling in our affairs but a sophisticated, multipronged attack against our most sacred democratic institutions. However, neither the administration nor Congress has done anything meaningful to fortify us from future attacks, instead downplaying and, in the case of Mr. Trump, often outright rejecting the findings."
"Paragraph: We come from an intelligence culture that eschews partisan politics. National security should not be a game for politicians to use for political leverage. Russian aggression is a real and present threat, the denial of which for political gain will only invite additional Russian interference. Our country is at risk every day the administration chooses to ignore this threat."
"Paragraph: The administration is rightly concerned about leaks of classified information, which appear to be on the rise. We know better than most that revealing classified intelligence can result in the exposure of sensitive intelligence programs and methods. In the worst cases, leaks can put actual lives on the line. However, divulging classified information and calling out inaction as well as wrongheaded or shortsighted decisions by our elected leaders and their senior advisers are very different things."

President Trump reignited controversy about Russia recently by declaring he believes that its president, Vladimir Putin, is sincere when he asserts that Moscow did not interfere in last year’s presidential election. The director of the C.I.A., Mike Pompeo, made similarly confounding remarks last month when he said that Russia’s campaign had failed to affect the outcome of the election, misrepresenting the formal judgment of the intelligence community. A C.I.A. spokesman later said that Mr. Pompeo had misspoken.As former C.I.A. officers, we find both of those comments deeply troubling. But another, less noticed remark by Mr. Pompeo was equally disturbing. He said that agency officers have an obligation to remain quiet about their work for a period that “far extends beyond the day you turn in your badge.” Even if his ire was trained primarily at specific outspoken former intelligence community leaders, his message to all former C.I.A. officers was clear: Stop speaking out.Our response to him is this: Respectfully, we won’t. As former C.I.A. officers, we would like to explain why we have decided to speak out about the troubling state of our country’s leadership and the dangerous implications for our national security.Two of us served as analysts focused on counterterrorism and broader security issues, while another of us was an operations officer for nearly three decades. Each of us served under presidents of both parties, and we all left the C.I.A. at different times and for different reasons. We fall on various points of the political spectrum, but at least one element unites us: We joined the C.I.A. because of our love of country and desire to protect the ideals upon which it was founded.AdvertisementOn our first day at C.I.A. headquarters, we raised our right hands and declared that we would protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Nowhere in that oath — or any of the reams of paperwork we signed — did we pledge to defend a specific president or a particular political party. Our loyalty oath was to something far greater, and that oath is the very reason we have chosen to be vocal.Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address. Please re-enter.You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.View all New York Times newsletters.Indeed, we believe we have a responsibility to call out when our leadership is not doing enough to keep America safe. We are most alarmed by the current administration’s continued denial of Russian interference in the presidential election, despite the high confidence judgment of the intelligence community to the contrary. In the most recent episode, President Trump has equivocated as to whom he believes: his own intelligence agencies or Mr. Putin, a retired K.G.B. colonel. It was only after a public outcry that President Trump, seemingly begrudgingly, cast his lot with American intelligence agencies, at least for the time being.AdvertisementIndeed, the intelligence community assessment was emphatic: Russia carried out an aggressive covert influence campaign, including cyberoperations, to give Mr. Trump an advantage and to undermine public faith in our democratic process. This was not the run-of-the-mill Russian meddling in our affairs but a sophisticated, multipronged attack against our most sacred democratic institutions. However, neither the administration nor Congress has done anything meaningful to fortify us from future attacks, instead downplaying and, in the case of Mr. Trump, often outright rejecting the findings.We come from an intelligence culture that eschews partisan politics. National security should not be a game for politicians to use for political leverage. Russian aggression is a real and present threat, the denial of which for political gain will only invite additional Russian interference. Our country is at risk every day the administration chooses to ignore this threat.The administration is rightly concerned about leaks of classified information, which appear to be on the rise. We know better than most that revealing classified intelligence can result in the exposure of sensitive intelligence programs and methods. In the worst cases, leaks can put actual lives on the line. However, divulging classified information and calling out inaction as well as wrongheaded or shortsighted decisions by our elected leaders and their senior advisers are very different things.The C.I.A. has a thoughtful process of pre-publication review of our public comments (including this essay) to ensure we protect secrets, sources and methods of intelligence. We were raised in the C.I.A. culture; we are proud of it and protective of its work.

"Paragraph: NEWARK — The jury in the federal corruption trial of Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, told the judge on Monday that they could not reach a unanimous decision on any of the charges in the case, raising the prospect of a mistrial."
"Paragraph: The lack of progress in the deliberations came hours after several jurors admitted that they had followed news accounts about a fellow juror who was excused last week. The excused juror then told reporters that she believed Mr. Menendez was not guilty and that the panel was having a difficult time achieving consensus."
"Paragraph: “As of 2 p.m., on behalf of all jurors, we cannot reach a unanimous decision on any of the charges,” the jurors wrote in a note to Judge William H. Walls. “Is there any additional guidance? What do we do now?”"
"Paragraph: After conferring with both the prosecution and the defense, Judge Walls dismissed the jury for the day, urging them to “go home and have a good meal, have a good sleep and then come back here and continue deliberations.”"
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for Mr. Menendez, said he believed that the judge’s instructions to come back on Tuesday and continue deliberating could be interpreted as a mandate to reach a verdict. Judge Walls noted his objection, but disagreed."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: Outside the federal courthouse here, Mr. Menendez again professed his innocence and his belief that the jurors would find him not guilty."
"Paragraph: “All of these jurors, save one, have been deliberating since Monday, and I would hope that at the end of the day, after they finish tomorrow, that those who continue to believe in my innocence will stand strong and that at the end of the day no juror will be coerced,” he said. “I believe no juror should be coerced.”"
"Paragraph: Mr. Menendez and a co-defendant, Dr. Salomon Melgen, a wealthy eye doctor from Florida, have been accused on various corruption charges, including bribery and conspiracy. Prosecutors say Mr. Menendez used his office to provide favors to Dr. Melgen in exchange for gifts, rides on his private plane and political contributions. Both men have denied the charges."
"Paragraph: The note from jurors came three hours after they had started a new round of deliberations after the juror was excused on Thursday so she could on a vacation that had been planned before the trail began. Her excusal, and subsequent media interviews, injected drama into a case that had been relatively staid."
"Paragraph: “I’m praying for him that they do not find him guilty,” Evelyn Maultsby, the excused juror, told reporters on Thursday."
"Paragraph: Ms. Maultsby’s comments, including accusing fellow jurors of preventing her from expressing her opinion, were widely broadcast, bringing national attention to the trial."

There is no way in God’s green earth that this judge is going to grant a mistrial when we have available to us a new jury.”"
"Paragraph: Nonetheless, the judge asked the jurors if any of them had seen news reports about Ms. Maultsby. He then interviewed those who had said yes in his chambers, with the defense and prosecution present, before returning to the bench and instructing the jury to restart deliberations."
"Paragraph: “You are now a new jury,” Judge Walls said. “You are to disregard whatever you negotiated or deliberated on last week. You’re starting fresh.”"
"Paragraph: He also issued new instructions. “Every juror has the right to communicate at any and all times with regard to deliberations,” Judge Walls said. “All you need to do is to step outside the door. The guards are there, and he’s on hand to take whatever message you want to give to me in writing.”"
"Paragraph: Ms. Maultsby’s comments represented a rare moment: an excused juror offering a window into the usually secretive deliberation process while sitting jurors were still debating."

Judge Walls did not give any such warning."

"Paragraph: Human behavior is often unpredictable. But immutable rules seem to govern certain situations, like Thanksgiving entertaining."
"Paragraph: Rule No. 1: You will be anxious before the holiday. "
"Paragraph: This is inescapable. You will worry that you have not sufficiently disguised the conditions under which you ordinarily live, which is what cleaning house usually achieves."
"Paragraph: You will be concerned that you do not have enough food, while at the same time fearing that you have too much, and that the turkey will be ready too soon, or too late, or never."
"Paragraph: You will dread underlying tensions among family members and overbearing behavior."
"Paragraph: I have not even mentioned the wine."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: Rule No. 2: The holiday always goes beautifully."
"Paragraph: This is the saving grace, invariably forgotten. If kept in mind, it can easily make these jittery few days far more bearable."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: For most families, Thanksgiving this year will not be unlike Thanksgiving any other year. Whatever new elements arrive in 2017, the foreboding is the same as always."
"Paragraph: Nonetheless, the projected disasters almost never occur. Everybody has a great time. Remembering this will not help to achieve preliminary serenity, but understanding the process can make the angst easier to endure."
"Paragraph: In order to help, the Thanksgiving wine panel annually tries to eliminate wine selections from your areas of concern. Each year, we share a Thanksgiving feast in advance. We each bring two bottles of wine to the meal, each costing no more than $25, with the aim of adding to our understanding of which types of wines work best."
"Paragraph: As with many families, we welcomed a new member this year. Our colleague Tejal Rao — sitting in for Julia Moskin, who was away on assignment — joined me, Florence Fabricant, Pete Wells and our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch."
"Paragraph: Over the years, we have learned and affirmed that wine is the least consequential issue anybody will face at Thanksgiving. Why is that?"
"Paragraph: Rule No. 3: If the food is good and the company convivial, you cannot go wrong with the wine. If the food is bad and the company annoying, wine can only help."
"Paragraph: What’s the worst that can happen with wine? Only one potential disaster looms: running out."
"Paragraph: The single most important guideline for selecting wine for Thanksgiving is simply to have enough on hand. We generally recommend one bottle per wine-drinking adult. This may seem like a lot, but it is simply a hedge against an insufficient supply. You do not have to finish it all. If you like, you can even give away unopened bottles with the leftovers."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: Beyond quantity, you need to provide both reds and whites. You can add rosé or a sparkling wine, but both red and white are essential. You will have guests who contend that red wine gives them headaches or white wine gives them heartburn. This is not the time to debate these issues. Let guests drink what they want unfettered."
"Paragraph: In our calculus, we imagine Thanksgiving as a large, freewheeling buffet meal, with lots of different dishes and a sprawling patchwork of flavors. It’s not the time to fret about pairing particular dishes with certain bottles. The trick is to provide versatile, nimble wines that pair well with many foods and will not be as fatiguing as everything else."
"Paragraph: That generally means bottles not especially high in alcohol, generally below 14 percent. They should not be tannic or oaky, but they must be energetic with lively acidity, which helps to refresh and cleanse the palate."
"Paragraph: Over the course of many years we have identified wines that almost always work well: Beaujolais and bone-dry sauvignon blancs are crowd-pleasers. Basic Italian reds made of barbera or sangiovese are fine, as are Italian whites made of fiano or carricante. Loire reds, pinot noirs, chardonnays, chenin blancs, mencías from Spain, rieslings — all are fine choices."
"Paragraph: These wines, I should say, fit our particular vision of the feast. If you are having a small dinner party for six with multiple courses and you would like to serve precious bottles poured into exquisite glasses, by all means do."
"Paragraph: For our party, we assume a crowd who might be drinking from tumblers or even paper cups. These are fine for big parties. But I do recommend steering clear of plastic goblets, which have a nasty habit of separating bowl from stem at the worst possible moments for your clothing, carpeting and anxiety threshold."
"Paragraph: Almost all the wines the panel sampled were excellent, and the few that fell short were nonetheless fine. Tejal brought the two most fascinating wines, both white, sort of."
"Paragraph: The first, the 2016 Caprice du Chameau from La Vrille et Le Papillon, a brother-and-sister team who make natural wines in the Ardèche region of southeastern France, was unfiltered, giving the wine a hazy appearance. Yet it was sublimely light and spicy, vibrant and thoroughly delicious. Surprisingly, it was made of viognier, which I usually associate with heavier, fruitier wines. Though visually unusual, the wine was ideal, with what Pete called “a feeling of over the river and through the woods.”"
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: Tejal’s second bottle was more challenging, a 2015 from RuBor Viticultores, made of chasselas, a Swiss white grape unaccountably planted 70 years ago in Cebreros in the Sierra de Gredos, a range of hills that cuts through central Spain. Though made from white grapes, the wine had been made as if it were a red. Instead of immediately separating the juice of the grapes from the skins, the producers macerated them together, extracting tannins and pigment."
"Paragraph: The gritty, amber-colored result was savory, intense and unusual, and perhaps better for a crowd of questing wine fanatics than a general-interest holiday group. I would happily serve it with cheese, though not for the long haul of a feast."
"Paragraph: Pete brought a rosé sparkling wine, a light, lacy cava from Dibon in the Penedès region of Spain. This fruity cava, unusually made entirely of the garnacha grape, would make a delightful aperitif, though we all would prefer not to drink sparkling wine throughout the feast."

"Paragraph: His other wine was an inspired selection, a 2013 Tinto, or red, from the intriguing Barraida region of Portugal from Sidónio de Sousa, made from the baga grape. It was spicy, herbal and lightly fruity, and had just the sort of light-bodied charm that could carry through the entire meal."
"Paragraph: Bernie took an unusual tack in selecting his white. He chose a Quincy, a Loire sauvignon blanc, because, he said, he remembered a meal many years ago when a Quincy was universally reviled."
"Paragraph: This suggestion of overt hostility to the group could not be rewarded. We disappointed him by thoroughly enjoying the wine, a clean, citrusy 2013 from Domaine Trotereau. We compounded the issue by liking his red even more, a 2013 pinot noir from Red Tail Ridge in the Finger Lakes. Its pale brick color seemed more typical of an older wine, but it was bright, juicy and fresh."
"Paragraph: Florence’s white, a 2016 sauvignon blanc from Matanzas Creek in Sonoma County, was an archetypal Thanksgiving white: neutral rather than flamboyant, a subtle character actor that would enhance rather than dominate. It had the sort of texture that continually invited another sip."
"Paragraph: Her red was also from Sonoma, a 2012 Buena Vista merlot. It had the opposite character of the Matanzas Creek, with fruit flavors that were too intense. Tejal called the effect “sinister,” but even so, it was easily tolerable."
"Paragraph: My own wines included a savory white Bordeaux, a 2015 Lune d’Argent from Clos des Lunes, made by the excellent Domaine de Chevalier. Though primarily sémillon with a quarter sauvignon blanc, it had a lot in common with the Matanzas Creek in that it was more interesting texturally than aromatically."
"Paragraph: Advertisement"
"Paragraph: My red was a 2015 Cahors from Château Combel-la-Serre, an easygoing wine that combined plummy fruit and chalky mineral flavors. It was made of malbec, but was more restrained than many of the fruity malbecs from Argentina."
"Paragraph: Collectively, most of these wines added good options to the tried-and-true selections. Tejal, however, second-guessed her choice of the Spanish chasselas. “I realized that maybe something I personally liked is not for everybody,” she said."
"Paragraph: She’s correct only to the extent of the distance that a wine lies from the mainstream. Otherwise, I live by the last rule."
"Paragraph: Rule No. 4: Choose wines that you like; everybody else will like them, too."

                Wines of The Times            By                     
                                    ERIC ASIMOV
                            
                NOV. 2, 2017
    Human behavior is often unpredictable. But immutable rules seem to govern certain situations, like Thanksgiving entertaining.Rule No. 1: You will be anxious before the holiday. This is inescapable. You will worry that you have not sufficiently disguised the conditions under which you ordinarily live, which is what cleaning house usually achieves.You will be concerned that you do not have enough food, while at the same time fearing that you have too much, and that the turkey will be ready too soon, or too late, or never.You will dread underlying tensions among family members and overbearing behavior.I have not even mentioned the wine.AdvertisementRule No. 2: The holiday always goes beautifully.This is the saving grace, invariably forgotten. If kept in mind, it can easily make these jittery few days far more bearable.AdvertisementFor most families, Thanksgiving this year will not be unlike Thanksgiving any other year. Whatever new elements arrive in 2017, the foreboding is the same as always.Nonetheless, the projected disasters almost never occur. Everybody has a great time. Remembering this will not help to achieve preliminary serenity, but understanding the process can make the angst easier to endure.In order to help, the Thanksgiving wine panel annually tries to eliminate wine selections from your areas of concern. Each year, we share a Thanksgiving feast in advance. We each bring two bottles of wine to the meal, each costing no more than $25, with the aim of adding to our understanding of which types of wines work best.As with many families, we welcomed a new member this year. Our colleague Tejal Rao — sitting in for Julia Moskin, who was away on assignment — joined me, Florence Fabricant, Pete Wells and our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch.Over the years, we have learned and affirmed that wine is the least consequential issue anybody will face at Thanksgiving. Why is that?Rule No. 3: If the food is good and the company convivial, you cannot go wrong with the wine. If the food is bad and the company annoying, wine can only help.What’s the worst that can happen with wine? Only one potential disaster looms: running out.The single most important guideline for selecting wine for Thanksgiving is simply to have enough on hand. We generally recommend one bottle per wine-drinking adult. This may seem like a lot, but it is simply a hedge against an insufficient supply. You do not have to finish it all. If you like, you can even give away unopened bottles with the leftovers.AdvertisementBeyond quantity, you need to provide both reds and whites. You can add rosé or a sparkling wine, but both red and white are essential. You will have guests who contend that red wine gives them headaches or white wine gives them heartburn. This is not the time to debate these issues. Let guests drink what they want unfettered.In our calculus, we imagine Thanksgiving as a large, freewheeling buffet meal, with lots of different dishes and a sprawling patchwork of flavors. It’s not the time to fret about pairing particular dishes with certain bottles. The trick is to provide versatile, nimble wines that pair well with many foods and will not be as fatiguing as everything else.That generally means bottles not especially high in alcohol, generally below 14 percent. They should not be tannic or oaky, but they must be energetic with lively acidity, which helps to refresh and cleanse the palate.Over the course of many years we have identified wines that almost always work well: Beaujolais and bone-dry sauvignon blancs are crowd-pleasers. Basic Italian reds made of barbera or sangiovese are fine, as are Italian whites made of fiano or carricante. Loire reds, pinot noirs, chardonnays, chenin blancs, mencías from Spain, rieslings — all are fine choices.These wines, I should say, fit our particular vision of the feast. If you are having a small dinner party for six with multiple courses and you would like to serve precious bottles poured into exquisite glasses, by all means do.For our party, we assume a crowd who might be drinking from tumblers or even paper cups. These are fine for big parties. But I do recommend steering clear of plastic goblets, which have a nasty habit of separating bowl from stem at the worst possible moments for your clothing, carpeting and anxiety threshold.Almost all the wines the panel sampled were excellent, and the few that fell short were nonetheless fine. Tejal brought the two most fascinating wines, both white, sort of.The first, the 2016 Caprice du Chameau from La Vrille et Le Papillon, a brother-and-sister team who make natural wines in the Ardèche region of southeastern France, was unfiltered, giving the wine a hazy appearance. Yet it was sublimely light and spicy, vibrant and thoroughly delicious. Surprisingly, it was made of viognier, which I usually associate with heavier, fruitier wines. Though visually unusual, the wine was ideal, with what Pete called “a feeling of over the river and through the woods.”AdvertisementTejal’s second bottle was more challenging, a 2015 from RuBor Viticultores, made of chasselas, a Swiss white grape unaccountably planted 70 years ago in Cebreros in the Sierra de Gredos, a range of hills that cuts through central Spain. Though made from white grapes, the wine had been made as if it were a red. Instead of immediately separating the juice of the grapes from the skins, the producers macerated them together, extracting tannins and pigment.The gritty, amber-colored result was savory, intense and unusual, and perhaps better for a crowd of questing wine fanatics than a general-interest holiday group. I would happily serve it with cheese, though not for the long haul of a feast.Pete brought a rosé sparkling wine, a light, lacy cava from Dibon in the Penedès region of Spain. This fruity cava, unusually made entirely of the garnacha grape, would make a delightful aperitif, though we all would prefer not to drink sparkling wine throughout the feast.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It was spicy, herbal and lightly fruity, and had just the sort of light-bodied charm that could carry through the entire meal.Bernie took an unusual tack in selecting his white. He chose a Quincy, a Loire sauvignon blanc, because, he said, he remembered a meal many years ago when a Quincy was universally reviled.This suggestion of overt hostility to the group could not be rewarded. We disappointed him by thoroughly enjoying the wine, a clean, citrusy 2013 from Domaine Trotereau. We compounded the issue by liking his red even more, a 2013 pinot noir from Red Tail Ridge in the Finger Lakes. Its pale brick color seemed more typical of an older wine, but it was bright, juicy and fresh.Florence’s white, a 2016 sauvignon blanc from Matanzas Creek in Sonoma County, was an archetypal Thanksgiving white: neutral rather than flamboyant, a subtle character actor that would enhance rather than dominate. It had the sort of texture that continually invited another sip.Her red was also from Sonoma, a 2012 Buena Vista merlot. It had the opposite character of the Matanzas Creek, with fruit flavors that were too intense. Tejal called the effect “sinister,” but even so, it was easily tolerable.My own wines included a savory white Bordeaux, a 2015 Lune d’Argent from Clos des Lunes, made by the excellent Domaine de Chevalier. Though primarily sémillon with a quarter sauvignon blanc, it had a lot in common with the Matanzas Creek in that it was more interesting texturally than aromatically.AdvertisementMy red was a 2015 Cahors from Château Combel-la-Serre, an easygoing wine that combined plummy fruit and chalky mineral flavors. It was made of malbec, but was more restrained than many of the fruity malbecs from Argentina.Collectively, most of these wines added good options to the tried-and-true selections. Tejal, however, second-guessed her choice of the Spanish chasselas. “I realized that maybe something I personally liked is not for everybody,” she said.She’s correct only to the extent of the distance that a wine lies from the mainstream. Otherwise, I live by the last rule.Rule No. 4: Choose wines that you like; everybody else will like them, too.★★★½ La Vrille et Le Papillon Vin de France Caprice du Chameau 2016 $15Bright, light and spicy, belying its cloudy, unfiltered appearance, with pure, unmediated flavors of pear and lime. (Fruit of the Vines, Long Island City, N.Y.)★★★ Matanzas Creek Sonoma County Sauvignon Blanc 2016 $20Not particularly expressive aromatically yet richly textured, lively, clean and refreshing.★★★ Dibon Penedès Cava Brut Rosé NV $17Light, pleasing, fruity and lacy; an ideal aperitif.

Warm rounds of individual jalapeño-studded cornbread were served while we sipped cocktails. Always on the prowl for something new for the Thanksgiving menu, I thought of the cornbread as we sampled these Thanksgiving wine selections. Phil Johnson, an owner of Gloria, provided the recipe. But for Thanksgiving, instead of the four-inch cornbread disks served at the restaurant, I baked the batter in madeleine pans. I then froze the little cakes, so I would have them for the holiday.

"Paragraph: During the summer of 2013, Joe Biden’s oldest son, Beau, learned he had a glioblastoma, an especially ferocious and pitiless type of brain tumor. Biden told almost no one. His grief did not spill into open view. But eventually, the world came to know. Beau Biden — Iraq War veteran, former attorney general of the state of Delaware — died on May 30, 2015. He was 46."
"Paragraph: Most civilians have the luxury, if you could call it that, of mourning privately. Biden did not. He repeatedly said that work was his salvation during that time, which wasn’t hard to believe. But you had to wonder about the nature of his dual existence.

"Paragraph: What’s most remarkable about Biden’s “Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose” is that he’s decided to give us full visibility into the agony and strangeness of that period, showing just what it was like to care for his son — and then mourn him — while simultaneously fulfilling his duties as vice president. The book is a backstage drama, honest, raw and rich in detail. People who have lost someone will genuinely take comfort from what he has to say."
"Paragraph: But this memoir is also a political book, one in which Biden touts his accomplishments and makes frequent forays into the wetlands of foreign and domestic policy. His position-paper entr’actes can be awkward and artless, much like the author himself. But after a time, you come to understand why he’s mixing in pages of his curriculum vitae with pages about grief: To Biden, the two are intertwined. It’s almost as if he suffers from a kind of political synesthesia. Deciding whether to run for the Democratic nomination in 2016, he writes, “was all tied up with Beau.”"

"Paragraph: Over Thanksgiving in 2014, Biden explains, Beau made it unambiguously clear that he wanted his father to run for president. This wish was at once selfless and self-protecting: Beau couldn’t bear the thought of his illness derailing his father’s political aspirations. Biden understood this. He went with it. The whole family did. Dreaming of 2016, he writes, sometimes became a kind of performance, a family diversion: “It was as if we were all keeping up an elaborate and needful charade.”"
"Paragraph: This charade also happened to suit Biden. Entertaining a presidential bid during those dark days gave him meaning, “a way to defy the fates.” And part of him obviously wanted to run."
"Paragraph: Biden’s life was full of surreal juxtapositions during Beau’s illness. One minute, he was sitting at his son’s bedside in the hospital; the next, he was in a specially designated room nearby, talking to the prime minister of Iraq. The work focused him, allowing him to contain his feelings. But those feelings would heave to the surface in private. On March 29, 2015, as Air Force Two was taking off, he wrote in his diary that he felt buoyed and hopeful. A few hours later, he added three staccato sentences. Just landed. 6:07.

Elton John. “You remember when I used to drive you and Hunt to school? That song we would all sing together, the three of us, as loud as we could?” Beau couldn’t answer by then; he was no longer capable of speech. But he smiled.

"Paragraph:  The inside track on Washington politics. "
"Paragraph: *Invalid email address"
"Paragraph: NEW YORK — An Alabama woman on Monday accused Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for Alabama’s open Senate seat, of sexually assaulting her and bruising her neck in the late 1970s when she was 16 years old."
"Paragraph: This new allegation follows an extensive report published Thursday by The Washington Post that detailed allegations that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32. The story also described his relationship with three other girls who were between the ages of 16 and 18 at the time. Moore has denied the allegations."
"Paragraph: Beverly Young Nelson, now 55, said Monday that she got to know Moore, now 70, in the late 1970s when she was a waitress at the Old Hickory House restaurant in the northeastern Alabama town of Gadsden, where Moore lived for much of his life."
"Paragraph: Nelson said at a news conference at a New York hotel that Moore, then the district attorney of Etowah County, was a regular at the restaurant and would sometimes compliment her looks or touch her long red hair. She showed a copy of her high school yearbook that she said Moore signed Dec. 22, 1977, with the inscription: “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say ‘Merry Christmas.’ ”"
"Paragraph: On a cold night about a week or two after that, Nelson alleges that Moore offered to give her a ride home from work after her shift ended at 10 p.m. Instead of taking her home, Nelson said that Moore pulled the two-door car into a dark and deserted area between a dumpster and the back of the restaurant. "
"Paragraph: When she asked what he was doing, Nelson alleges that Moore put his hands on her breasts and began groping her. When she tried to open the car door and leave, Nelson said he reached over and locked the door. When she yelled at him to stop and tried to fight him off, she alleges that he tightly squeezed the back of her neck and tried to force her head toward his lap. He also tried to pull her shirt off, she said."
"Paragraph: “I was determined that I was not going to allow him to force me to have sex with him. I was terrified,” Nelson said during the news conference, often becoming emotional as she described the attack that she alleges occurred about 40 years ago. “I thought that he was going to rape me.”"

Article Content:  The inside track on Washington politics. *Invalid email addressNEW YORK — An Alabama woman on Monday accused Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for Alabama’s open Senate seat, of sexually assaulting her and bruising her neck in the late 1970s when she was 16 years old.This new allegation follows an extensive report published Thursday by The Washington Post that detailed allegations that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32. The story also described his relationship with three other girls who were between the ages of 16 and 18 at the time. Moore has denied the allegations.Beverly Young Nelson, now 55, said Monday that she got to know Moore, now 70, in the late 1970s when she was a waitress at the Old Hickory House restaurant in the northeastern Alabama town of Gadsden, where Moore lived for much of his life.Nelson said at a news conference at a New York hotel that Moore, then the district attorney of Etowah County, was a regular at the restaurant and would sometimes compliment her looks or touch her long red hair. She showed a copy of her high school yearbook that she said Moore signed Dec. 22, 1977, with the inscription: “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say ‘Merry Christmas.’ ”On a cold night about a week or two after that, Nelson alleges that Moore offered to give her a ride home from work after her shift ended at 10 p.m. Instead of taking her home, Nelson said that Moore pulled the two-door car into a dark and deserted area between a dumpster and the back of the restaurant. When she asked what he was doing, Nelson alleges that Moore put his hands on her breasts and began groping her. When she tried to open the car door and leave, Nelson said he reached over and locked the door. When she yelled at him to stop and tried to fight him off, she alleges that he tightly squeezed the back of her neck and tried to force her head toward his lap. He also tried to pull her shirt off, she said.“I was determined that I was not going to allow him to force me to have sex with him. I was terrified,” Nelson said during the news conference, often becoming emotional as she described the attack that she alleges occurred about 40 years ago. “I thought that he was going to rape me.”Bill Armistead, the chairman of Moore’s Senate campaign, denied Nelson’s accusations in a statement Monday afternoon and accused her attorney, Gloria Allred, of being “a sensationalist leading a witch hunt.” Nelson is the fifth woman to publicly accuse Moore of pursuing her when she was a teenager. “We’ve said this before and we’ll say it again: Judge Moore is an innocent man and has never had any sexual misconduct with anyone. This is a witch hunt against a man who has had an impeccable career for over 30 years and has always been known as a man of high character,” Armistead said in the statement. “Let it be understood: The truth will come forward, we will pursue all legal options against these false claims and Judge Moore will be vindicated.” [Woman says Roy Moore initiated sexual encounter when she was 14, he was 32] At the news conference in New York, Nelson said that during the incident, she kept fighting Moore, with tears rolling down her face, and he eventually stopped.

"Paragraph: *Invalid email address"
"Paragraph: Brett J. Talley, the young lawyer nominated by President Trump for a lifetime federal judgeship in Alabama, was asked by a Senate committee to disclose family members who are likely to present potential conflicts of interest if he is confirmed."
"Paragraph: In response, Talley said he would evaluate “real or potential conflict, or relationships that could give rise to appearance of conflict” and recuse himself from cases if necessary, according to a Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire."
"Paragraph: He did not, however, identify any family members — including his wife, who is one of President Trump’s attorneys. Annie Donaldson is White House Counsel Donald F. McGahn II’s chief of staff."
"Paragraph: Talley’s failure to mention his wife in the 30-page written questionnaire was first reported Monday by the New York Times."
"Paragraph: Talley could not be immediately reached for comment."
"Paragraph: The White House did not respond to questions about whether the administration sees a potential conflict of interest and whether Talley should have disclosed that he is married to a White House attorney."
"Paragraph: A spokesman for the Senate Judiciary Committee and its chairman, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), did not respond to a call seeking comment."
"Paragraph: As a district judge, Talley could end up presiding over cases in which the federal government or the White House is one of the parties. For example, district judges in Hawaii and Maryland had previously heard cases challenging the Trump administration’s travel ban."
"Paragraph: Charles Geyh, an Indiana University law professor, said Talley’s marriage to a White House attorney is not bothersome and should not disqualify him from his nomination. Federal judges are required by law to recuse themselves in cases that present conflicts of interest."
"Paragraph: But, Geyh said, “the 800-pound gorilla was that it was not disclosed.”"
"Paragraph: “It makes it, at the very least, incredibly poor form. . . . It’s something that the Senate has every right to be in front of it to decide whether it’s a problem,” said Geyh, who teaches and writes about judicial ethics and conduct."
"Paragraph:   [He has never tried a case, but Trump wants to make him judge for life]  "
"Paragraph: Talley attracted controversy for what some say is his limited experience in practicing law and the level of partisanship he had shown in the past. The Judiciary Committee, on which Republicans outnumber Democrats, approved Talley’s nomination last week on a party-line vote."
"Paragraph: His nomination is now headed to the Senate for a full confirmation vote."
"Paragraph: Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, said the Senate should not confirm Talley in light of the new revelation."
"Paragraph: “By failing to disclose that his wife is one of President Trump’s lawyers, Talley has betrayed his obligation to be open and transparent with the Senate and American people,” Feinstein said in a statement, adding later: “Talley’s nomination shouldn’t be considered by the Senate unless he answers questions about this glaring omission that [clarify] matters concerning when he would recuse himself.”"
"Paragraph: Feinstein said reports that Donaldson has been interviewed by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s team as it investigates Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election show “a clear conflict of interest that should have been disclosed.” The Times reported that Mueller’s team recently talked to Donaldson about her notes on conversations with McGahn regarding the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey."
"Paragraph: Feinstein and other Democrats on the committee have opposed Talley’s nomination, citing his lack of trial experience, and political comments he previously made on social media, on his political blog and in several opinion pieces he has written for CNN. The American Bar Association, which vets federal judicial nominees, has rated Talley as “not qualified.”"
"Paragraph: Talley, a 36-year-old lawyer from Alabama who writes horror stories on the side, has practiced law for only three years and has yet to try a case."
"Paragraph: Before his nomination in September, he had been unequivocal about his political views. For example, one tweet from his account, which has since been made private, says, “Hillary Rotten Clinton might be the best Trumpism yet.”"
"Paragraph: On his political blog called Government in Exile, he wrote a post with the title, “A Call to Arms: It’s Time to Join the National Rifle Association,” in January 2013, a month after a gunman in Newtown, Conn., killed 27 people before taking his own life. He criticized gun-control advocates, who, he said, “have exploited” the Newtown mass shooting to advance an agenda to strip people of their Second Amendment rights."
"Paragraph: Answering written questions from Democrats on the Judiciary Committee about his previous political statements, Talley said he would recuse himself in cases in which his impartiality is questioned, as required by federal statute, and that his personal views on the Second Amendment and other issues “will have no bearing on how I would rule in a case.” He also said the blog post calling on people to join the NRA was meant to attract opposing views and encourage constructive discussion."
"Paragraph:   [Trump judicial nominee draws more scrutiny over anti-LGBT comments: ‘We discriminate’]  "
"Paragraph: Challenged about his lack of trial experience, Talley said he had previously argued motions in federal district court on behalf of the state of Alabama, often through written briefs rather than in person. He also said he had argued cases before the 11th Circuit Appeals Court and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. He said it would be “inappropriate” for him to comment on his recommendation for the federal bench — a decision made by two U.S. senators from Alabama, Richard C. Shelby and Luther Strange."
"Paragraph: Geyh, the law professor, said revelations of Talley’s failure to disclose also could raise questions about whether his proximity to political power played a role in his nomination."
"Paragraph: “We do have a cronyism concern; that because of his association with members of the Senate and members of the White House that he’s being considered for a position that the ABA says he’s unqualified [for],” Geyh said. “To what extent is the president doing this as a favor for someone he knows? To what extent is this an arrangement in favor of home state senators who are indifferent to [Talley’s] qualifications?”"
"Paragraph: Talley graduated from Harvard Law School in 2007. Shortly after, he became a law clerk in Alabama, spending two years in a federal-district court and another two at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. He worked as a political speechwriter for three years, first for Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign in 2012 and then for Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) from 2013 to 2015."
"Paragraph: In April 2015, Talley became an Alabama deputy solicitor general, a position he held for nearly two years until he became deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department in January."
"Paragraph: In a statement defending Talley’s nomination, Grassley said he does not believe “extensive trial experience” is the only factor in deciding on a nominee’s qualifications."
"Paragraph: “Mr. Talley has a wide breadth of various legal experience that has helped to expose him to different aspects of federal law and the issues that would come before him,” Grassley said."
"Paragraph: Talley’s nomination comes as Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) continue to intensify efforts to place conservative jurists on the federal bench."
"Paragraph: Talley and Donaldson were married in August 2015."
"Paragraph: Donaldson was an associate for the Washington law firm Jones Day before she was appointed to the White House post. She is one of several lawyers from the firm who were tapped to join the Trump administration, some as attorneys for the White House, including McGahn."
"Paragraph: Among the others: Greg Katsas, James Burnham and David Morrell, who now work in the Office of the White House Counsel."
"Paragraph: Katsas, Trump’s deputy counsel, is also a judicial nominee. The Senate last week approved Katsas’s nomination to an appellate court in Washington."

"Paragraph: The head of the Senate Republican campaign committee said Monday that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore is “unfit to serve,” and he should be expelled from the Senate if he wins next month’s election, following allegations that he initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32. "
"Paragraph: The urgent repudiation from National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) came just hours after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Moore should end his Senate campaign in Alabama. "
"Paragraph: The comments marked the most forceful effort yet by Senate Republican leaders to pressure Moore to step aside since The Washington Post reported the allegations on Thursday. "
"Paragraph: In a written statement, Gardner said that he believes “the individuals speaking out against” Moore. He added: “If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him.”"
"Paragraph: Speaking in Louisville, Ky., Monday morning, McConnell called on Moore to step aside. Asked by a reporter whether he believed the allegations, McConnell responded: “I believe the women, yes.”"
"Paragraph: But Moore was defiant, showing no signs that he was preparing to bow out. He wrote on social media that McConnell is the one “who should step aside” and that he has “failed conservatives.”"
"Paragraph: The Post reported Thursday that Leigh Corfman alleged that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 and Moore was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney. Moore has denied the allegations and has vowed to continue his campaign. "
"Paragraph:  [Woman says Roy Moore initiated sexual encounter when she was 14, he was 32] "
"Paragraph: Although it is too late to remove Moore’s name from the ballot before the Dec. 12 special election, McConnell said he is exploring the option of a write-in campaign by Sen. Luther Strange, whom Moore defeated in the primary, or another Republican. "
"Paragraph: Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who expressed solidarity with McConnell’s rejection of Moore, wrote on Twitter that Strange would be “an excellent alternative.”"
"Paragraph: Scott Jennings, a former McConnell aide, wrote a column published Monday endorsing a highly unusual proposal that has generated chatter among Republicans: Jeff Sessions should step down as attorney general and run for the seat, which he vacated to join the Trump administration earlier this year. "
"Paragraph: “President Trump should intervene,” Jennings wrote in the Louisville Courier-Journal, by demanding the Alabama Republican Party “withdraw Moore’s name as a candidate, which it almost certainly would do if ordered by the White House; dispatch a still-popular Sessions to run a write-in candidacy; and campaign for and hope Sessions wins.”"
"Paragraph: A Sessions spokeswoman at the Justice Department did not immediately comment on the proposal. "
"Paragraph: McConnell made his comments Monday morning in Louisville, where he was touting the GOP’s tax reform plan. Last week, McConnell said that “if” the allegations were true, Moore would need to step aside, stopping short of the position he took Monday. "
"Paragraph: In addition to Corfman, three other women interviewed by The Post in recent weeks say Moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s, episodes they said they found flattering at the time, but troubling as they got older. None of the three women said that Moore forced them into any sort of relationship or sexual contact."
"Paragraph: Moore has declined to rule out that he may have dated girls in their late teens when he was in his 30s, but he has said he did not remember any encounters. "
"Paragraph:  [Senate candidate Roy Moore does not rule out that he may have dated teen girls when he was in his 30s] "
"Paragraph: Sen. Susan Collins (R-Me.) wrote on Twitter Monday that after reviewing Moore’s statement and a radio interview in which he denied the claims, “I did not find his denials to be convincing and believe that he should withdraw from the Senate race.”"
"Paragraph: Last week, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said President Trump believed that “if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.”"
"Paragraph: Asked about Moore, Trump more recently has told reporters traveling with him in Asia that “I have not seen very much about him, about it.”"
"Paragraph: Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, said Sunday that Moore needs time to defend himself against the allegations and that Trump will look more closely at the issue after he returns from his trip. "
"Paragraph: Also on Sunday, Moore sought to refocus his campaign on the conservative religious ideals most likely to motivate his base voters, dismissing the controversy surrounding his campaign. "
"Paragraph: Addressing a gathering at the Huntsville Christian Academy in Huntsville, Ala., on Sunday night, the former state judge suggested that he was investigating his accusers, threatened to sue The Washington Post and called on the United States to restore its culture by going “back to God.”"
"Paragraph: “We can be proud of where we came from and where we’re going if we go back to God,” Moore said at his second public event since The Post reported the allegations of misconduct last week."
"Paragraph: “If we go back to God, we can be unified again,” he said."
"Paragraph: Neither Corfman nor any of the other women sought out The Post. While reporting a story in Alabama about supporters of Moore’s Senate campaign, a Post reporter heard that Moore allegedly had sought relationships with teenage girls. Over the following three weeks, two Post reporters contacted and interviewed the four women. All were initially reluctant to speak publicly but chose to do so after multiple interviews, saying they thought it was important for people to know about their interactions with Moore."
"Paragraph: Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) criticized Moore Monday. He also distanced himself from the campaign of Democratic nominee Doug Jones, who is trying to demonstrate independence from national party figures in hopes of winning some crossover votes in Alabama, which leans heavily conservative. "
"Paragraph: “I thought Moore never belonged in the Senate even before these allegations,” said Schumer. As for the Jones effort, Schumer said, “when they ask us for help, we’ll do it. But it’s been an Alabama race.”"
"Paragraph:  The allegations against Moore were beginning to become an issue in midterm campaigns outside Alabama. Democrats on Monday sought to highlight instances where Republican congressional candidates had not said Moore should step down. "
"Paragraph: Some Democrats have floated the idea of trying to expel Moore from the Senate if he is victorious. "
"Paragraph: Speaking on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” which aired Sunday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) floated the idea of expelling Moore from the Senate if he is victorious. "
"Paragraph: “We may not have much choice on that but we have choice on something else,” said Klobuchar, who recently co-sponsored a bill requiring sexual harassment training for senators and their staff members. “That is that you can expel a senator once they are in with two-thirds of the vote after the ethics committee does an investigation.”"
"Paragraph: But Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said that unseating a senator is “several steps removed from where we are today,” arguing that Trump needs to “do more when it comes to this situation in Alabama.”"

Article Content:  The inside track on Washington politics. *Invalid email addressThe head of the Senate Republican campaign committee said Monday that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore is “unfit to serve,” and he should be expelled from the Senate if he wins next month’s election, following allegations that he initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32. The urgent repudiation from National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) came just hours after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Moore should end his Senate campaign in Alabama. The comments marked the most forceful effort yet by Senate Republican leaders to pressure Moore to step aside since The Washington Post reported the allegations on Thursday. In a written statement, Gardner said that he believes “the individuals speaking out against” Moore. He added: “If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him.”Speaking in Louisville, Ky., Monday morning, McConnell called on Moore to step aside. Asked by a reporter whether he believed the allegations, McConnell responded: “I believe the women, yes.”But Moore was defiant, showing no signs that he was preparing to bow out. He wrote on social media that McConnell is the one “who should step aside” and that he has “failed conservatives.”The Post reported Thursday that Leigh Corfman alleged that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 and Moore was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney. Moore has denied the allegations and has vowed to continue his campaign.  [Woman says Roy Moore initiated sexual encounter when she was 14, he was 32] Although it is too late to remove Moore’s name from the ballot before the Dec. 12 special election, McConnell said he is exploring the option of a write-in campaign by Sen. Luther Strange, whom Moore defeated in the primary, or another Republican. Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who expressed solidarity with McConnell’s rejection of Moore, wrote on Twitter that Strange would be “an excellent alternative.”Scott Jennings, a former McConnell aide, wrote a column published Monday endorsing a highly unusual proposal that has generated chatter among Republicans: Jeff Sessions should step down as attorney general and run for the seat, which he vacated to join the Trump administration earlier this year. “President Trump should intervene,” Jennings wrote in the Louisville Courier-Journal, by demanding the Alabama Republican Party “withdraw Moore’s name as a candidate, which it almost certainly would do if ordered by the White House; dispatch a still-popular Sessions to run a write-in candidacy; and campaign for and hope Sessions wins.”A Sessions spokeswoman at the Justice Department did not immediately comment on the proposal. McConnell made his comments Monday morning in Louisville, where he was touting the GOP’s tax reform plan. Last week, McConnell said that “if” the allegations were true, Moore would need to step aside, stopping short of the position he took Monday. In addition to Corfman, three other women interviewed by The Post in recent weeks say Moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s, episodes they said they found flattering at the time, but troubling as they got older. None of the three women said that Moore forced them into any sort of relationship or sexual contact.Moore has declined to rule out that he may have dated girls in their late teens when he was in his 30s, but he has said he did not remember any encounters.  [Senate candidate Roy Moore does not rule out that he may have dated teen girls when he was in his 30s] Sen. Susan Collins (R-Me.) wrote on Twitter Monday that after reviewing Moore’s statement and a radio interview in which he denied the claims, “I did not find his denials to be convincing and believe that he should withdraw from the Senate race.”Last week, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said President Trump believed that “if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.”Asked about Moore, Trump more recently has told reporters traveling with him in Asia that “I have not seen very much about him, about it.”Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, said Sunday that Moore needs time to defend himself against the allegations and that Trump will look more closely at the issue after he returns from his trip. Also on Sunday, Moore sought to refocus his campaign on the conservative religious ideals most likely to motivate his base voters, dismissing the controversy surrounding his campaign. Addressing a gathering at the Huntsville Christian Academy in Huntsville, Ala., on Sunday night, the former state judge suggested that he was investigating his accusers, threatened to sue The Washington Post and called on the United States to restore its culture by going “back to God.”“We can be proud of where we came from and where we’re going if we go back to God,” Moore said at his second public event since The Post reported the allegations of misconduct last week.“If we go back to God, we can be unified again,” he said.Neither Corfman nor any of the other women sought out The Post. While reporting a story in Alabama about supporters of Moore’s Senate campaign, a Post reporter heard that Moore allegedly had sought relationships with teenage girls. Over the following three weeks, two Post reporters contacted and interviewed the four women. All were initially reluctant to speak publicly but chose to do so after multiple interviews, saying they thought it was important for people to know about their interactions with Moore.Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) criticized Moore Monday. He also distanced himself from the campaign of Democratic nominee Doug Jones, who is trying to demonstrate independence from national party figures in hopes of winning some crossover votes in Alabama, which leans heavily conservative. “I thought Moore never belonged in the Senate even before these allegations,” said Schumer. As for the Jones effort, Schumer said, “when they ask us for help, we’ll do it. But it’s been an Alabama race.” The allegations against Moore were beginning to become an issue in midterm campaigns outside Alabama. Democrats on Monday sought to highlight instances where Republican congressional candidates had not said Moore should step down. Some Democrats have floated the idea of trying to expel Moore from the Senate if he is victorious. Speaking on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” which aired Sunday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) floated the idea of expelling Moore from the Senate if he is victorious. “We may not have much choice on that but we have choice on something else,” said Klobuchar, who recently co-sponsored a bill requiring sexual harassment training for senators and their staff members. “That is that you can expel a senator once they are in with two-thirds of the vote after the ethics committee does an investigation.”But Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said that unseating a senator is “several steps removed from where we are today,” arguing that Trump needs to “do more when it comes to this situation in Alabama.” Dino Grandoni and John Wagner contributed to this report.

"Paragraph: *Invalid email address"
"Paragraph: During the 2016 election, President Trump repeatedly asked black Americans what they had to lose by sending him to the White House to succeed the country's first black president."
"Paragraph: Well apparently, the courts."
"Paragraph: According to an analysis by the Associated Press, 91 percent of Trump’s nominees to U.S. federal courts are white, and 81 percent are male. Three out of every four of the nominees are white men The last president to nominate a similarly homogeneous group was George H.W. Bush. Also according to the analysis, more than a quarter of Trump's nominees are white males who will replace women or people of color:"
"Paragraph: “The shift could prove to be one of Trump’s most enduring legacies. These are lifetime appointments, and Trump has inherited both an unusually high number of vacancies and an aging population of judges. That puts him in position to significantly reshape the courts that decide thousands of civil rights, environmental, criminal justice and other disputes across the country. The White House has been upfront about its plans to quickly fill the seats with conservatives, and has made clear that judicial philosophy tops any concerns about shrinking racial or gender diversity.”"
"Paragraph: Courts were a large issue during the 2016 election."
"Paragraph: Former president Barack Obama considers diversifying the courts to be among his greatest legacies. His nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court made her the first Hispanic justice on the country's highest bench. And in terms of federal benches as a whole, the Obama administration nominated a higher percentage of people of color to federal judgeships than any other president."
"Paragraph: Just months before the 2016 election, Obama spoke to University of Chicago law students about his commitment to diversity on the bench”"
"Paragraph:  “I am — not to brag — but I have transformed the federal courts from a diversity standpoint with a record that's been unmatched."
"Paragraph: We've got more African Americans on the circuit courts than we ever has before. We've got — I've appointed more African American women to the federal courts than any other president before. I've appointed more Latinos than any president before. I've appointed more Native Americans, more Asian Americans, more LGBT judges than ever before."
"Paragraph: But at no point did I say, oh, you know what, I need a black lesbian from Skokie in that slot. Can you find me one? I mean, that's just not how I've approached it.  It turns out that if the process is fair and you are saying that it's important that our courts are reflective of a changing society, you’ll end up with a really good cross-section of people who are excellent. And that's who we've been able to appoint.”"
"Paragraph: Those in the Obama administration have said that the president wanted the benches to look like America. But Trump and other conservatives have regularly criticized Obama from nominating “activist judges” more concerned with political ideology than reflecting the ethnic and gender diversity of the country."
"Paragraph: Activism isn't exclusive to liberalism. But  Trump critics say that the president isn't interested in keeping political activism out of the courts. He simply wants judges that reflect the politics of some of his most loyal supporters."
"Paragraph: During the campaign, Trump was praised by conservatives for taking the unusual step of releasing a list of judges he would consider nominating to the Supreme Court if he was elected president. Most of the names were suggested by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative public policy think tank. And the move was viewed as an effort to reassure conservatives that the former Hillary Clinton donor would carry out their judicial agenda in office."
"Paragraph: Trump went on to win 80 percent of white evangelical voters, with one of the main reasons being his promise to nominate judges that support the politics of one of his most loyal demographic groups, according to the New York Times."
"Paragraph: “He wooed them and convinced them that he would appoint Supreme Court justices in the mold of Antonin Scalia, the conservative who died in February. To these pragmatic players, the election boiled down to only two issues, both that could be solved with Supreme Court appointments: stopping abortion and ensuring legal protections for religious conservatives who object to same-sex marriage.”"
"Paragraph: Despite low approval ratings — only 37 percent of adults approve of Trump's job performance, the overwhelming majority of white evangelical voters — 73 percent — view his job performance favorably, according to the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll."
"Paragraph: And appreciating his judicial appointments is one of those reasons."
"Paragraph: But Americans looking for more ethnic and gender diversity in Trump's nominees might want to focus on the group the president has tasked with choosing the nominees."
"Paragraph: “We’re going to have great judges, conservative, all picked by the Federalist Society,” Trump told former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon while on the campaign trail."
"Paragraph: The group will gather in Washington, D.C., this week for the 2017 National Lawyers Convention. Here's a list of the individuals chosen to speak at the event."

"Paragraph: Stephen K. Bannon has identified the perfect person to convince Alabama voters who might be wavering on Roy Moore that the GOP Senate candidate's alleged pursuit of teenage girls is nothing more than a smear campaign by Democrats, establishment Republicans and the media, all working in cahoots: NBC's Chuck Todd."
"Paragraph: “Even Chuck Todd, the swampiest creature of swamp creatures, he walked through it yesterday on 'Meet the Press,'\" Bannon said Monday on the “Breitbart News Daily” SiriusXM radio show. “He said it felt completely orchestrated.”"
"Paragraph: One problem: That's not really what Todd said."
"Paragraph: Todd's “orchestrated” assessment referred to the way Capitol Hill Republicans responded, almost in unison, to The Washington Post's report that four women claim Moore inappropriately touched, kissed or tried to date them when they were teens and he was in his 30s."
"Paragraph: “Mitch McConnell, the way he's been — this clearly felt almost orchestrated,” Todd said. “The minute, within an hour, this came out, many of the McConnell allies came out and said, 'He's got to go.' Sounds like Mitch McConnell has decided it's worse if Roy Moore wins.”"
"Paragraph: It did indeed appear that McConnell and fellow Republicans had agreed their position would be that Moore should drop out if the allegations against him were true. On Monday, hours before a fifth woman came forward and claimed that Moore groped her when she was 16, McConnell said he believes the first four women are telling the truth."
"Paragraph: Republicans orchestrating their response to the allegations is not improper and certainly not the same thing as colluding with Democrats and the media to publish a false report. But Bannon is trying to muddy the waters and dupe voters into believing that even Chuck Todd suspects Moore is the victim of a conspiracy."
"Paragraph: Why? Because Bannon thinks the perception that Todd is on his side will make his argument stronger."

"Paragraph: Shortly before Roy Moore's latest accuser came forward Monday afternoon, an Alabama political reporter appeared on CNN to defend him. What Moore is accused of doing was only a misdemeanor in 1979, emphasized Brandon Moseley of ALReporter.com: “If [Moore] had stolen a lawn mower at age 21, would that be a reason not to elect him 50 years later?”"
"Paragraph: The comments made Moseley only the latest Moore defender to downplay the severity of alleged sexual touching initiated by a 32-year-old man on a 14-year-old girl."
"Paragraph: In case there was any doubt, we are now way, way beyond stolen-lawn mower comparison."
"Paragraph: Beverly Young Nelson on Monday accused Moore of what basically amounts to sexual assault — even attempted rape. Seated next to attorney Gloria Allred, Nelson said Moore offered her a ride and then parked in a dimly lit area behind a diner she worked at before groping her, locking the doors, and trying to force her head into his lap. “I thought he was going to rape me,” she said, constantly choking back tears. She was 16 at the time."
"Paragraph: Part of the lack of a united outcry against Moore in the GOP have been the questions about how much wrong he's accused of doing. However crass the lawn mower comparison is, the then-14-year old, Leigh Corfman, described a scene in which Moore initiated touching that she wasn't comfortable with, but she didn't accuse him of attempted rape or even sexual assault, in so many words. Even if she didn't, Alabama state law both today and back then labels this kind of behavior “sexual abuse in the second degree.” It is indeed a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail. And the other three women who told The Post that Moore dated them when they were between 16 and 18 were technically of consenting age (16) at the time."
"Paragraph: This new allegation is by far the most serious, and moves this well beyond legal and moral gray areas into an alleged felony — and one about which Nelson says she is willing to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. She also has a high school yearbook that she says Moore signed for her."
"Paragraph: It shouldn't be terribly surprising that another woman has come forward with such an allegation — that tends to be the case — but Nelson's allegation takes this in a wholly different direction. If Moore was capable of this kind of alleged forcible assault, it stands to reason that there will be more stories to come."
"Paragraph: Not that Moore's supporters will find it difficult to shift tactics. They'll simply move away from the lawn mower analogies and biblical comparisons to casting doubt on the accusations themselves. But this certainly makes it no longer tenable to claim that this is a misunderstanding from a bygone era in the United States or a very specific region of the country. And these Moore defenders have to ask themselves how much more they'll be asked to defend or dispute in the days and weeks to come."
"Paragraph: National Republicans are now quickly trying to rid themselves of Moore's mess. After the news conference Monday, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) said the Senate should expel Moore even if he's elected on Dec. 12 — an outcome that can hardly be ruled out at this point — “because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate.”"
"Paragraph: But while the national establishment has clearly decided this needs to be dispatched with — and fast — the ones that really need convincing are Moore and Alabama Republicans. Either Moore drops out or the state party withdraws his nomination. Beyond that, this drama could last another month and possibly longer, or it could conclude with Democrats winning the seat and the GOP's majority being cut in half."

"Paragraph: *Invalid email address"
"Paragraph: There was a theory before the 2016 presidential election that Donald Trump’s political rhetoric and personal history might turn the election into a rout. Women, it was theorized, might balk at voting for the Republican at unprecedented levels, making it all-but-impossible for Trump to win the White House."
"Paragraph: Obviously, that didn’t happen. While Trump did receive fewer votes, he won the electoral college and the presidency. Women backed Hillary Clinton, according to exit polling, but by a margin generally in line with how they’d voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Men backed Trump by about the same margin as they had George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004."
"Paragraph: Despite Clinton’s loss, 2017 has been a year in which there’s been a noticeable shift in the demonstrated power — political and otherwise — of women: more women running for office. A massive protest/rally in Washington in January. Uncovering decades of sexual harassment and abuse at the hands of powerful men. Clinton once said that the “future is female”; the present seems to be, too."
"Paragraph: At Axios, Mike Allen speculates that this might have an effect on the 2018 elections."
"Paragraph: “Trump won narrowly, and his unprecedented coalition included many suburban and exurban women who couldn’t stomach Hillary Clinton,” Allen wrote. “If those voters were to tip dramatically to Democrats in 2020, Republicans would suddenly have a massive math problem.”"
"Paragraph: Unless men tipped the other way."
"Paragraph: Consider what happened in 2016. Last November, women preferred Clinton by about 12 percentage points and men preferred Trump by about the same margin, according to exit polling. For women, that was a 1-point shift to the Democrats relative to 2012. For men, it was a 5-point shift to the Republicans. At the same time, the percentage of the electorate that was female declined and the percent that was male increased. That combination meant victory for Trump, however narrowly."
"Paragraph: There are margins of error here that add gray area around all of the calculations, but the pattern in recent presidential elections is fairly consistent. The chart below shows exit poll results since 1976 (as compiled by Cornell’s Roper Center). Since 1992, women have consistently backed the Democrats and consistently made up more than half of the electorate. The vote among men has varied more often during that period."
"Paragraph: "
"Paragraph: The more immediate question for 2018 is how women and men have voted in House elections. Last year, the margin between men and women in the presidential election was the widest it has been in any presidential election since 1976. Interestingly, the margin of support for Democratic House candidates by women matched the highest since 1994."
"Paragraph: "
"Paragraph: As with the presidential results, there’s been a consistent pattern in House voting since 1992. More women voting, and they are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates."
"Paragraph: "
"Paragraph: Since 1992, though, there have only been three elections in which the Democrats won a majority of the House: 1992, 2006 and 2008. (Democrats won more votes in 2012 but not control of the chamber.)"
"Paragraph: Those are also the only three races since then in which men have backed Democrats more heavily in House races."
"Paragraph: "
"Paragraph: The one election where women backed Republicans more heavily than Democrats was in the Republicans’ 2010 rout."
"Paragraph: On the column chart above, you’ll notice that the three elections with the smallest difference between how men and women voted were also 1992, 2006 and 2008, when women were more likely to support Democratic candidates by 6, 8 and 8 points respectively.

Article Content:  Analysis  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events   The inside track on Washington politics. *Invalid email addressThere was a theory before the 2016 presidential election that Donald Trump’s political rhetoric and personal history might turn the election into a rout. Women, it was theorized, might balk at voting for the Republican at unprecedented levels, making it all-but-impossible for Trump to win the White House.Obviously, that didn’t happen. While Trump did receive fewer votes, he won the electoral college and the presidency. Women backed Hillary Clinton, according to exit polling, but by a margin generally in line with how they’d voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Men backed Trump by about the same margin as they had George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004.Despite Clinton’s loss, 2017 has been a year in which there’s been a noticeable shift in the demonstrated power — political and otherwise — of women: more women running for office. A massive protest/rally in Washington in January. Uncovering decades of sexual harassment and abuse at the hands of powerful men. Clinton once said that the “future is female”; the present seems to be, too.At Axios, Mike Allen speculates that this might have an effect on the 2018 elections.“Trump won narrowly, and his unprecedented coalition included many suburban and exurban women who couldn’t stomach Hillary Clinton,” Allen wrote. “If those voters were to tip dramatically to Democrats in 2020, Republicans would suddenly have a massive math problem.”Unless men tipped the other way.Consider what happened in 2016. Last November, women preferred Clinton by about 12 percentage points and men preferred Trump by about the same margin, according to exit polling. For women, that was a 1-point shift to the Democrats relative to 2012. For men, it was a 5-point shift to the Republicans. At the same time, the percentage of the electorate that was female declined and the percent that was male increased. That combination meant victory for Trump, however narrowly.There are margins of error here that add gray area around all of the calculations, but the pattern in recent presidential elections is fairly consistent. The chart below shows exit poll results since 1976 (as compiled by Cornell’s Roper Center). Since 1992, women have consistently backed the Democrats and consistently made up more than half of the electorate. The vote among men has varied more often during that period.The more immediate question for 2018 is how women and men have voted in House elections. Last year, the margin between men and women in the presidential election was the widest it has been in any presidential election since 1976. Interestingly, the margin of support for Democratic House candidates by women matched the highest since 1994.As with the presidential results, there’s been a consistent pattern in House voting since 1992. More women voting, and they are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates.Since 1992, though, there have only been three elections in which the Democrats won a majority of the House: 1992, 2006 and 2008. (Democrats won more votes in 2012 but not control of the chamber.)Those are also the only three races since then in which men have backed Democrats more heavily in House races.The one election where women backed Republicans more heavily than Democrats was in the Republicans’ 2010 rout.On the column chart above, you’ll notice that the three elections with the smallest difference between how men and women voted were also 1992, 2006 and 2008, when women were more likely to support Democratic candidates by 6, 8 and 8 points respectively. This is largely because men moved to the left. In no election since 1992 have men backed Republicans more heavily in exit polling and Democrats won more House seats.That’s the question raised by 2017. Will there be a rejection of Republican candidates by women and, if there is, to what extent would it offset the vote of men?The most recent Post-ABC poll asked Americans how they plan to vote in the 2018 House races. The Democrats hold an 11-point advantage on that question.Among women, Democrats are preferred by 20 points. Among men, it’s tied.

"Paragraph: In television appearances Monday, former vice president Joe Biden said he would not have taken Hillary Clinton’s place as the Democratic Party’s 2016 presidential nominee even if he had been given the chance."
"Paragraph: Donna Brazile, the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, claimed in a new memoir that she considered initiating a process to swap Clinton out for Biden last year after Clinton fainted at a Sept. 11 memorial event. On NBC’s “Today” show Monday, Biden told host Matt Lauer that Brazile’s book was the first time he or any of his staff heard of such a possibility."
"Paragraph: “I give you my word,” Biden said. “I would never have taken it. I was for Hillary. I did 83 campaign events for Hillary. I think I can say I did more events and worked harder for Hillary, as hard for Hillary, as anyone else. She would have been a first-rate president.”"
"Paragraph:   [Donna Brazile: I considered replacing Clinton with Biden as 2016 Democratic nominee]  "
"Paragraph: Biden noted he had already decided, long before last fall, that he was not prepared to run for president. His oldest son, Beau Biden, died of brain cancer in May 2015, and the former vice president repeatedly said last year that he knew he wouldn’t be able to withstand the pressures of a campaign while grieving."
"Paragraph: “I was not ready in terms of my family,” Biden told Lauer. “So, no, I would never have done that.”"
"Paragraph: Biden certainly sounded like a would-be candidate on “Today” as he discussed the changes he felt the Democratic Party needed to make to be successful — and refused to rule out the possibility of running in 2020. He fielded questions from audience members about gun violence, President Trump’s performance and whether voters would be put off by Biden’s age in a presidential race. Biden, 74, would be 77 if he decided to run for president in 2020."
"Paragraph: “Look, I think people have a right to ask your age, your health. I think if anyone were to run for president, you should fully disclose your medical records,” he said. “Right now — as my mother would say, knock on wood — I’m healthy. I’m in pretty good shape. But, you know, that’s a way off. If we run, I think it’s a legitimate issue for people to raise.”"

"Paragraph: In an interview on NBC’s “Megyn Kelly Today,” host Kelly laid out the challenges Biden would face if he did enter the 2020 race."
"Paragraph: “The critics will say you are too old — you are going to be 77 in 2020 — you wouldn’t have any new ideas, you have already run twice and lost,” she said. “You would have to promise it would be one term only and … the blue-collar Rust Belters … you would need to get elected already love Donald Trump.”"
"Paragraph:   [Joe Biden on politics of fear: ‘The American people will not sustain this attitude for long’]  "
"Paragraph: Biden didn’t miss a beat. “They love me more,” he told Kelly to audience laughter. “But they are right about all the first parts, correct. I am not sure I can overcome the front end, but I understand the Rust Belt. Donald Trump has no notion of what those people are going through.”"
"Paragraph: When Kelly asked him whether he was “getting any closer” to deciding, however, Biden said no."
"Paragraph: “If the Lord came down and sat here and said, ‘Look, the nomination is yours if you accept it now,’ I would say, ‘No, not now,’” he told Kelly. “Because I’m not ready. There’s so much more to do in terms of finishing this book, finishing the ability to try to win back the House of Representatives. And then we’ll see.”"
"Paragraph: He added: “I’ve become a great respecter of fate. It’s not being blunt — I think I’m qualified to be president, but there’s a lot of really talented people out there in the Democratic Party.”"
"Paragraph: As The Washington Post’s Philip Rucker reported, Brazile would not have had the power to unilaterally replace Clinton with Biden. Nevertheless, the claims Brazile made in her new book, “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House,” prompted a wave of outraged responses from former Clinton campaign officials who said they “do not recognize the campaign she portrays in the book.”"
"Paragraph: “We were shocked to learn the news that Donna Brazile actively considered overturning the will of the Democratic voters by attempting to replace Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine as the Democratic Presidential and Vice Presidential nominees,” read an open letter signed by more than 100 former campaign aides. “It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate’s health.”"

"Paragraph: Conservative writer Ben Shapiro is set to speak at UCLA on Monday after a spat between the university and the campus Republican club over security fees for the event."
"Paragraph: Shapiro, a conservative writer and editor of the website the Daily Wire, attracted protesters when he spoke at UC Berkeley earlier this fall. Nine people were arrested."
"Paragraph: The UCLA student group Bruin Republicans balked last month at the prospect of paying security fees for Shapiro’s visit and the university ultimately relented, saying they would cover the cost for basic security at the event."
"Paragraph: Under a 2009 policy that the university is now reviewing, the school foots the entire security bill for events in which students, faculty and staff make up at least 70% of the audience."
"Paragraph: Administrators asked the Republican club representatives to sign an agreement that would hold them personally liable for security costs if the audience for the Shapiro event does not reach that threshold."
"Paragraph: The students protested and an attorney for the group wrote a letter saying making the conservative political club pay security fees would be an unconstitutional violation of 1st Amendment free speech rights because most of the other 1,200 student organizations haven’t had to do so when they’ve sponsored events."
"Paragraph: “Given UCLA’s commitment to free speech, and to avoid any appearance to the contrary, UCLA has decided to also pay the basic security costs for this event,” UCLA spokesman Tod Tamberg said in a statement. “UCLA will be adopting this approach going forward while it reviews its current policy to ensure that it continues to be a useful planning tool for UCLA and registered student organizations.”"
"Paragraph: Tamberg said in the statement that “basic security costs” are a few thousand dollars which the Bruin Republicans told the university they could not afford. He said the university “always planned” to pay all additional security costs if protests were triggered by the event."
"Paragraph: UC Berkeley officials put in intense security for his talk earlier this fall, including shutting down and clearing out large swaths of the campus. Campus Republicans paid about $9,000 for that event and the university spent more than $600,000, UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said."
"Paragraph: The protests that met Shaprio were relatively subdued compared to the protests in the spring when right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos tried to speak on campus."
"Paragraph: Shapiro is a far less controversial figure. He resigned from the then-Stephen-Bannon-led Breitbart News after a colleague of his accused then-Trump-campaign-manager Corey Lewandowski of assaulting her."
"Paragraph: During the election, his critiques of Trump made him one of the more prominent opponents of the then-Republican nominee in the conservative movement."
"Paragraph: This opposition to candidate Trump also made him the target of anti-Semitic harassment. The Anti-Defamation League released a report last fall detailing anti-Semitic harassment of journalists on Twitter during the first half of the 2016 election cycle. It found Shapiro to be the No. 1 target."
"Paragraph: There did not appear to be planned protests ahead of Shaprio’s visit to UCLA on Monday."
"Paragraph: Alabama's Senate race has become a tossup, a new poll says. About 550,000 homes in Southern California have the highest risk of fire damage. The California state Senate is changing how it handles sexual harassment complaints. Enrollment of first-time international students in U.S. colleges dipped last year. "

"Paragraph: Given the hand-wringing over the Trump administration’s reported demand that AT&T divest CNN as a condition of approving its $85-billion acquisition of Time Warner, CNN’s parent, you’d think that Trump was interfering in a merger that could only do good things for the public interest."
"Paragraph: But that’s wrong. It has been crystal clear since the deal was announced about a year ago that the government should block the proposed merge. Forcing AT&T to sell CNN would be a positive step in averting all the ills that will emanate from the merger, but only a modest step. The companies shouldn’t be allowed to combine at all."
"Paragraph: Trump’s rhetoric about the deal, which dates back to his presidential campaign, has muddled the issues—and may even have increased the chances that the deal will go through with all its negative aspects intact. His administration’s alleged demand, delivered via Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, that AT&T sell off the Turner Broadcasting portion of TIme Warner, and specifically CNN, has been taken as an artifact of Trump’s war with CNN over its reporting on his administration."
"Paragraph: True, Trump whines about any news organization that reports on him negatively, but he seems to reserve the greatest venom for CNN—who can forget the video he posted on Twitter in July of him supposedly beating up on a figure with a CNN logo for its head at a wrestling event?"
"Paragraph: “The Trump effect is overshadowing the underlying issues with this deal,” says John Bergmayer, senior counsel to the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. “We welcome people looking into the issues of political influence over antitrust decision-making, but this is still a deal that should be analyzed on its own merits.”"
"Paragraph: Public Knowledge even joined with a clutch of Tea Party and other conservative groups to urge Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions to block the deal unless its harmful aspects can be prevented, an unlikely prospect. “Allowing these firms to join forces,” the groups asserted in an Oct. 26 letter to Sessions, “would intolerably limit consumers’ control over what they watch and where they get their information.”"
"Paragraph: Let’s look at the underlying issues, and then at how Trump has complicated matters."
"Paragraph: AT&T is the nation’s largest provider of pay TV (following its 2015 acquisition of DirecTV), as well as its second-largest wireless company and third-largest broadband internet provider. Time Warner is one of the nation’s largest content companies, the owner of CNN, HBO, Warner Bros. and the cable channels TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network and Turner Classic Movies, among numerous other entertainment and news offerings."
"Paragraph: \n\nApparently we’re supposed to sympathize with the giant conglomerates AT&T and Time Warner. They’re so beleaguered by changes in their core businesses that their only path to survival, so they say, is a merger valued at $85.4 billion that will keep their fleeing customers corralled."

"Paragraph: \n\nApparently we’re supposed to sympathize with the giant conglomerates AT&T and Time Warner. They’re so beleaguered by changes in their core businesses that their only path to survival, so they say, is a merger valued at $85.4 billion that will keep their fleeing customers corralled."
"Paragraph: \n\nConsumer advocates..."
"Paragraph: In antitrust jargon, the deal would be a “vertical” merger, bringing together business at different levels of a given industry, rather than a “horizontal” merger, which applies to deals that bring together two largely identical businesses—two cable firms merging, for example."
"Paragraph: Normally, vertical mergers are treated as less anti-competitive than their horizontal cousins, since they don’t eliminate a competitor from the marketplace. But mergers of distributors of information and entertainment content with creators of that content raise special concerns. The danger is that AT&T, which owns the internet pipeline into an ever-increasing share of American homes, could use that power to steer its internet customers to its own content and degrade or block competing material."
"Paragraph: Kept separate, content distribution companies such as AT&T and DirectTV have an incentive to offer their subscribers the best possible TV package. Content companies just want to create material that will attract the largest number of viewers. Put them together and their business incentives change drastically."
"Paragraph: The new AT&T “might not want to give too good a deal to DISH Network (a satellite competitor of DirecTV), because it wants people to become DirecTV customers,” Bergmayer argues. “There’s not even a question about whether AT&T’s TV packages are going to carry Time Warner programming, because of course they are. But that may be at the expense of viewers or competing programmers that might have something better, but aren’t even going to be considered.”"
"Paragraph: \n\nThe Trump administration’s determination to roll back regulations protecting the environment, voting rights and financial services consumers has been drawing most of the public’s attention. But a stunningly swift and thorough deregulatory campaign is happening elsewhere in Washington: at the Federal..."
"Paragraph: \n\nThe Trump administration’s determination to roll back regulations protecting the environment, voting rights and financial services consumers has been drawing most of the public’s attention. But a stunningly swift and thorough deregulatory campaign is happening elsewhere in Washington: at the Federal..."
"Paragraph: Up to now, Federal Communications Commission rules promoting network neutrality tended to act against such behavior by mandating that internet service providers give all content equal access to the customer. But under Trump’s newly appointed FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, the commission is moving toward scrapping network neutrality principles."
"Paragraph: The usual solution for potential conflicts in vertical mergers has been to impose behavioral conditions. That was the approach that enabled the FCC to wave through the giant merger of Comcast and NBCUniversal in 2011. The merged company was under orders not to use its nearly nationwide distribution footprint to squeeze out cable channels or video services that competed with NBC’s channels or Comcast’s video streaming service."
"Paragraph: That didn’t work. Content providers have lodged frequent complaints about unfair treatment. Bloomberg, for example, complained that Comcast sequestered its news channel in a hard-to-find ghetto on its cable programming grid, reducing its viewership. Bloomberg won its case before the FCC, but only after two years of litigation."
"Paragraph: The Santa Monica-based Tennis Channel also fought a long battle to avoid being isolated in what one might consider the nosebleed section of Comcast’s channel lineup, ostensibly to protect Comcast’s own sports channels, the Golf Channel and Versus (now the NBC Sports Network), from competition. The FCC’s enforcement staff agreed with the Tennis Channel, but it lost its battle in the courts."
"Paragraph: \n\nComcast customers and their advocates may believe that the cable company's reputation for wretched service was the key factor in federal regulators' distaste for its proposed merger with Time Warner Cable, which has now been called off."
"Paragraph: \n\nIt's probably true that this was one factor; public forums..."
"Paragraph: \n\nComcast customers and their advocates may believe that the cable company's reputation for wretched service was the key factor in federal regulators' distaste for its proposed merger with Time Warner Cable, which has now been called off."
"Paragraph: \n\nIt's probably true that this was one factor; public forums..."
"Paragraph: One could argue that the FCC finally found a way to punish Comcast for its misbehavior when it effectively killed the company’s proposed merger with Time Warner Cable last year. (Time Warner Cable isn’t affiliated any longer with AT&T’s quarry, Time Warner.) But that happened only after years of complaints about Comcast’s behavior."
"Paragraph: Nor is the same approach likely to work with AT&T. “The sorry history of mega-mergers shows they run roughshod over the public interest,” former FCC Commissioner Michael Copps, now a special advisor to Common Cause, said when the AT&T deal was announced. “Further entrenching monopoly harms innovation and drives up prices for consumers.”"
"Paragraph: On the surface, Trump’s objection to the AT&T-Time Warner merger might appear to have the same roots as consumer advocates’ concerns. But the context of his position statements generally has been undifferentiated anti-media diatribes. A few weeks before the 2016 election, for example, he lumped the AT&T deal together with the ownership of the Washington Post by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and the ownership of NBC by Comcast. \"They're trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people,\" he said. (An NBC production, “Access Hollywood,” generated the notorious tape that featured Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women.)"
"Paragraph: Trump’s established animosity toward CNN could give AT&T grounds to fight administration efforts to block its merger in court, as reflecting political influence. Ironically, AT&T was rumored months ago to be shopping CNN to other buyers in a post-merger slimming. The latest reports forced AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson to disavow any such efforts."
"Paragraph: \"Ii’s important to set the record straight,\" Stephenson said in a written statement issued in response to reports of the DOJ’s position on CNN. \"Throughout this process, I have never offered to sell CNN and have no intention of doing so.\" Stephenson’s statement may be taken as a signal that AT&T won’t capitulate to political pressure, but its refusal to sell CNN could end up being the wrong thing done for the right reason. AT&T shouldn’t own CNN—and it shouldn’t own any of Time Warner’s other content either."
"Paragraph: Alabama's Senate race has become a tossup, a new poll says. About 550,000 homes in Southern California have the highest risk of fire damage. The California state Senate is changing how it handles sexual harassment complaints. Enrollment of first-time international students in U.S. colleges dipped last year. "

AT&T shouldn’t own CNN—and it shouldn’t own any of Time Warner’s other content either.Alabama's Senate race has become a tossup, a new poll says. About 550,000 homes in Southern California have the highest risk of fire damage. The California state Senate is changing how it handles sexual harassment complaints. Enrollment of first-time international students in U.S. colleges dipped last year.

"Paragraph: Here's our look at the Trump administration and the rest of Washington."
"Paragraph: A fifth woman has come forward to accuse former Alabama chief justice Roy Moore of inappropriate sexual conduct."
"Paragraph: Beverly Young Nelson, 55, said Moore, now a candidate for the U.S. Senate, assaulted her when she was a 16-year-old high school student working as a waitress in Gadsden, Ala."
"Paragraph: Speaking at a news conference in New York, Nelson said Moore was then a 30-year-old deputy district attorney in Etowah County and a regular customer at Olde Hickory House restaurant in Gadsden. He often complimented her on her looks and pulled on the ends of her long, red hair, she said."
"Paragraph: Initially, she said, \"I did not attach any significance to Mr. Moore's behavior towards me and I did not respond to any of Mr. Moore's flirtatious behavior.\""
"Paragraph: A few days before Christmas in 1977, Nelson said, she brought her high school yearbook into the restaurant and Moore asked if he could sign it.  She said yes, and he wrote, “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say ‘Merry Christmas.’”"
"Paragraph: He signed it, “Love, Roy Moore D.A.,” according to photocopies of the page provided to reporters by Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred, who is representing Nelson."
"Paragraph:  About a week or two later, Nelson said, Moore offered her a ride home. Unable to reach her boyfriend, who was supposed to pick her up, she accepted."
"Paragraph:  “I trusted Mr. Moore because he was the district attorney,” she said. “I thought that he was simply doing something nice.”"
"Paragraph:  But instead of driving to the highway, Nelson said, Moore drove to the back of the restaurant and began to grope her, putting his hand on her breasts and later squeezing the back of her neck, attempting to force her head toward his crotch."
"Paragraph: “I thought that he was going to rape me,” she said. “I was twisting and I was struggling and I was begging him to stop.”"
"Paragraph: Nelson said he eventually allowed her to open the car door and she either fell out or was pushed out. She said Moore told her that \"no one will ever believe you\" if she told anyone about what had happened."
"Paragraph: Monday was the first time Nelson disclosed the allegations publicly, though she said she had previously told her sister, mother and husband about her encounter with Moore."
"Paragraph: Nelson’s remarks follow a report by the Washington Post last week detailing the accounts of four women who say Moore had sexual or romantic encounters with them when they were minors. One of the women was 14 years old at the time."
"Paragraph: The allegations have upended the Senate race in Alabama, threatening President Trump's agenda in Congress and leaving Republicans split over how far they’re willing to go to save the seat from a Democrat."
"Paragraph: Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor, could be expected to pick up votes from the unfolding controversy, though he has declined to raise the issue in his campaign so far."
"Paragraph: Moore's Senate campaign immediately responded to the new allegations, insisting again that all of the reports are unfounded."
"Paragraph: \"Gloria Allred is a sensationalist leading a witch hunt, and she is only around to create a spectacle. Allred was the attorney who claims credit for giving us Roe v. Wade which has resulted in the murder of tens of millions of unborn babies,\" campaign chairman Bill Armistead said in a statement."
"Paragraph: \"We’ve said this before and we’ll say it again: Judge Moore is an innocent man and has never had any sexual misconduct with anyone. This is a witch hunt against a man who has had an impeccable career for over 30 years and has always been known as a man of high character.\""
"Paragraph: Moore has refused to quit the campaign despite mounting political pressure, most recently from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). "
"Paragraph: Anticipating claims that her disclosure was politically motivated, Nelson said she and her husband had supported Donald Trump for president."
"Paragraph:  “This has nothing to do with Republicans or Democrats,” she said. “It has everything to do with Mr. Moore’s sexual assault when I was a teenager.”"

"Paragraph: While some of the new costumes provide protection for the women's internal organs, many leave the fighters depending only on their god-like abs of steel for defense."

"Paragraph: After tweeting on Thursday that he planned to discuss the sexual misconduct allegations against his friend Louis C.K., actor and comedian Marc Maron has followed through on his promise. "
"Paragraph: On the latest episode of his podcast \"WTF,\" Maron unpacked his thoughts and feelings about the C.K. accusations and clarified what he knew about the stories beforehand as well as his own experience with unwanted sexual conduct. "
"Paragraph: \"He's my friend and it's a difficult position to be in,\" Maron said. \"Because I certainly can't condone anything he did. There was no way to justify it. There's no way to defend it. There's no way to apologize for him about it.\""
"Paragraph: Maron moved on to address whether there was culpability for C.K.'s actions, given that rumors about his now-admitted inappropriate behavior had swirled around the comedy community for years."
"Paragraph: \"There was a story out there,\" Maron said, \"going back several years. That there were unnamed people in the story. Took place in a hotel room in Aspen. It was always out there but then it would pick up momentum at different times and I would ask him about it.\""
"Paragraph: The podcast host and star of Netflix's \"GLOW\" recalled asking C.K. about the story, if it were true that he made women watch him masturbate, and said that C.K. always denied it. "
"Paragraph: When Maron would suggest C.K. quash the rumor publicly, the \"Louie\" creator would say, \"No, I can't. I can't do that. It'll give it life. It'll give it air.\""
"Paragraph: Maron also had thoughts on the empathy required for men to force themselves out of their own head space and into a woman's perspective and the struggle he's had with acknowledging the inherent power dynamic involved in the workplace."
"Paragraph: \"In a situation where there's a power dynamic. In a situation where you're not even seeing a person. You're just seeing a person who is there to receive your garbage,\" Maron said of overcoming \"man brain.\" \"It's hard to understand that the power dynamic is real and it exists because things have been the way they've been for a long time.\""
"Paragraph: Before the episode was over, Maron also attempted to illustrate the problematic nature of C.K.'s actions to those who may wish to dismiss them on grounds of not being illegal. "
"Paragraph: He shared a story of being a college undergraduate struggling with a philosophy class and finding guidance from the professor, a man he looked up to. "
"Paragraph: Maron described the professor as a \"powerful, impactful guy\" and said, \"I wanted him to acknowledge me as someone who is smart, who is on the right path, who is going to do it.\""
"Paragraph: The professor and Maron grabbed dinner one night and afterward, his teacher kissed him. "
"Paragraph: \"And my body went into like a paralysis,\" Maron recalled. \"It was almost like a leaving-the-body kind of moment and I could not do anything.\" "
"Paragraph: Though careful not to suggest his own experience was on the same level as that of the women C.K. targeted, Maron explained what made the encounters so devastating."
"Paragraph: \"Well, the big deal is that it's boundary-shattering. It is traumatizing. It is unexpected,\" he said. \"These things — they may not destroy your life. They may not even register in the big picture. But they're stuck there. They're stuck there as trauma.\""
"Paragraph: The latest episode of \"WTF\" can be heard here. "
"Paragraph: Radhika Jones will succeed Graydon Carter as Vanity Fair's editor in chief."
"Paragraph: The former New York Times books editor will be the magazine's fifth editor in chief since its modern revival in 1983, publisher Condé Nast announced Monday following a report of her appointment that was published over the weekend."
"Paragraph: \"There is nothing else out there quite like Vanity Fair,\" Jones said in a statement.  \"It doesn't just reflect our culture — it drives our understanding of it. It can mix high and low, wit and gravitas, powerful narrative and irresistible photography. It has a legacy of influential reporting, unmatchable style and, above all, dedication to its readers. I am honored to succeed Graydon Carter as editor and excited to get to work.\""
"Paragraph: Carter, who has served as the magazine's editor since 1992, announced in September that he was stepping down after he feeling that he'd \"pretty much accomplished everything\" he ever wanted to do."
"Paragraph: Jones earned a nod of approval from Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor in chief who also serves as Condé Nast's artistic director. Wintour called the newly minted chief \"a fearless and brilliant editor whose intelligence and curiosity will define the future of Vanity Fair in the years to come.\""
"Paragraph: Jones previously served as deputy managing editor at Time magazine and editorial director of the New York Times' book section. She begins her new gig at Vanity Fair on Dec. 11, overseeing all content development, production and consumer experiences for the magazine's numerous platforms, Condé Nast said."
"Paragraph: She will also head up the glossy's iconic Oscars party, the fifth annual New Establishment Summit and the brand's 105th anniversary, as well as continue the digital expansion of the mag's new vertical, the Hive."
"Paragraph: A \"Lord of the Rings\" TV series is coming to Amazon."
"Paragraph: The Seattle-based e-commerce giant announced Monday that is has acquired the global television rights to J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy novels. It has given a multiple-season commitment to a TV adaptation slated to debut on its streaming service. "
"Paragraph: The series will be produced by Amazon Studios in cooperation with the Tolkien Estate and Trust, book publisher HarperCollins, and New Line Cinema, a division of Warner Bros. Entertainment behind the film adaptations."
"Paragraph: The TV adaptation will, according to a press release, \"explore new storylines preceding 'The Fellowship of the Ring.'\" The deal also allows for potential spinoff series. "
"Paragraph: \"'The Lord of the Rings' is a cultural phenomenon that has captured the imagination of generations of fans through literature and the big screen,” said Sharon Tal Yguado, head of scripted series at Amazon Studios. “We are ... thrilled to be taking 'The Lord of the Rings' fans on a new epic journey in Middle-earth.”"
"Paragraph: It makes sense that Amazon would pursue the rights to the fantasy novels. CEO Jeff Bezos has made it known that he wants the streamer to find its own \"Game of Thrones.\" And \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, directed by Peter Jackson and starring Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and Sean Astin among others, grossed nearly $6 billion worldwide. "
"Paragraph: “We are delighted that Amazon, with its longstanding commitment to literature, is the home of the first-ever multi-season television series for 'The Lord of the Rings,'” said Matt Galsor, a representative for the Tolkien Estate and Trust and HarperCollins."
"Paragraph: Mindy Lahiri's colorful costumes, accessories and a slew of amusing props from \"The Mindy Project\" are going up for auction to mark the show's series finale. "
"Paragraph: Hulu, Universal Television and ScreenBid are hosting an online auction featuring 45 items from Mindy Kaling's sitcom to celebrate the final episode Tuesday. "
"Paragraph: Items on the block include Mindy's \"Microwave Cooking for One\" book from Season 1, Danny's chewed pen from Season 2 and Danny and Mindy's wedding invitation set from Season 4, as well as several costumes from the show's six seasons."
"Paragraph: Opening bids range from $25 to $500. Iconic costumes created by Emmy-nominated costume designer Salvador Perez start at $200."
"Paragraph: The auction begins Monday at 9 p.m. Pacific Time (midnight on the East Coast) and ends Nov. 27. Ten specific items will be auctioned to benefit the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. "
"Paragraph: Browsing through Mindy's closet now. Later, baby."
"Paragraph: John Oliver didn't have much time to spare on Sunday night's Season 4 finale of \"Last Week Tonight,\" giving the bulk of the episode over to dissecting the twisted behemoth that is the Trump presidency."
"Paragraph: But the \"Daily Show\" alumni did carve out a moment to savage the recently exposed Louis C.K. sexual misconduct scandal with just a few brief lines."
"Paragraph: \"We saw everything from Republicans continuing to roll out their tax reform plan, with all the grace of a horse falling down a spiral staircase,\" Oliver said of the past week, \"to the New York Times reporting Louis C.K.’s gross sexual misconduct.\""
"Paragraph: That would be conduct which, according to Oliver, \"is completely indefensible and which inevitably resulted in the cancellation of his new film, 'Exhibit A If This Ever Goes to Trial.'\""
"Paragraph: Oliver was referring to C.K.'s unreleased film \"I Love You, Daddy,\" a black-and-white effort that many critics view as a blatant homage to the work of Woody Allen, that dissects the power imbalance implicit between young women and older men. "
"Paragraph: On Thursday, the New York Times published the stories of five women who accused C.K. of masturbating in front of them —  or asking if he could. On Friday, C.K. admitted that the incidents were true."
"Paragraph: Even before C.K. verified the accusations were accurate, the distributor for \"I Love You, Daddy,\" the Orchard, announced that it would not move forward with the release of the film. "
"Paragraph: The entirety of this week's episode of \"Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\" can be seen on HBO Go."
"Paragraph: Taylor Swift's long-awaited \"Reputation\" is already assured to be one of the best-selling album launches in recent history. Now the singer has a stadium tour to go with it."
"Paragraph: Swift announced the first round of U.S. dates for her \"Reputation\" tour on Monday morning. It is set to begin May 9 in Arizona, and includes a Rose Bowl show May 19. It is scheduled to wrap up in Texas in October. "
"Paragraph: This tour will make use of Ticketmaster's Verified Fan program, the groundbreaking if controversial effort with which fans can boost their place in the ticket-buying line (and hopefully beat scalpers) by purchasing albums and merchandise and sharing Swift content on social media."
"Paragraph: The effort already seems to have worked in one respect: Last week, \"Reputation\" sold an estimated 700,000 albums — that's sales alone, not even streaming equivalents — on its first day of release."
"Paragraph: Carrie Underwood, who broke her wrist Friday, says she'll be all right given a little time to heal. "
"Paragraph: The country singer, who last week co-hosted the CMA Awards for the 10th year, fell on the steps outside her Nashville home Friday, according to the Tennessean. In addition to the wrist injury, she was treated at a hospital for cuts and bruises, her representative told the paper. "
"Paragraph: \"Thanks so much for all the well wishes everybody...I’ll be alright...might just take some time...glad I’ve got the best hubby in the world to take care of me,\" Underwood tweeted on Sunday."
"Paragraph: Mike Fisher, her husband since 2010, flew home overnight to be with her, according to People. CMAs co-host Brad Paisley also wished her a swift recovery."
"Paragraph: Unfortunately, she wasn't able to take part in Sunday's Country Rising benefit concert to assist victims of the Las Vegas shooting and help with hurricane recovery. "
"Paragraph: \"Supergirl\" star Melissa Benoist has spoken out in the wake of sexual harassment accusations against co-showrunner Andrew Kreisberg, who has been suspended pending an investigation by Warner Bros. "
"Paragraph: \"I am a woman who leads a show that supports equality and feminism, empowerment and fighting for what is right. I have always tried to conduct myself this way personally, as well,\" Benoist said in a statement posted Sunday night on Twitter. \"Sadly, the show and my career are a part of an industry that doesn't always mirror these sentiments.\""
"Paragraph: In a Variety story Friday, 15 women and four men detailed years of alleged misconduct by Kreisberg, including frequent touching without permission, asking for massages from female staff members and sexualized comments about women's appearances."
"Paragraph: Kreisberg has denied the accusations. Warner Bros. is conducting an investigation with the cooperation of Berlanti Productions, which oversees the producer's shows. Variety said its sources chose to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation."
"Paragraph: Benoist didn't directly mention Kreisberg — who serves as an executive producer on The CW's \"Arrow,\" \"The Flash\" and \"DC's Legends of Tomorrow\" in addition to \"Supergirl\" — but addressed the atmosphere of the aftermath of allegations against him."
"Paragraph: \"This is heartbreaking, and at times makes me feel helpless. I know I’m not the only one who feels this way,\" she wrote. \"But I’m an optimist. I believe lasting change is possible, and when people are mistreated, they should have a safe forum to speak their trust and always be heard.\" "
"Paragraph: She continued: \"And when people commit crimes or harass others they should always be held accountable — no matter what industry they work in or how much power they wield.\""
"Paragraph: Benoist then moved to advocate that people, including herself, should continue speaking up in the face of wrongdoing and to hold themselves to a higher standard."
"Paragraph: \"So this week, I’ll head back to work on Supergirl even more committed to being a part of changing the norm by listening when people speak up, and refusing to accept an environment that is anything less than a safe, respectful and collaborative space,\" she concluded."
"Paragraph: The third season of \"Supergirl\" is airing on the CW. It premiered on CBS in 2015 and moved to its current home for its second cycle. "
"Paragraph: Failure is not always failure. "
"Paragraph: That was the resounding message from the L.A. premiere of \"The Disaster Artist\" at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. James and Dave Franco and Seth Rogen were among the stars on hand Sunday to celebrate a film that chronicles the creation of director Tommy Wisea's 2003 movie \"The Room.\""
"Paragraph: \"I love Hollywood stories,\" said James Franco, who along with his brother read actor Greg Sestero's book \"The Disaster Artist\" and decided to make it into a movie."
"Paragraph: \"This was unlike any Hollywood story I'd ever heard of and read about,\" said James Franco, who directed and produced the movie. \"I read the book and thought this would be so unusual and weird, but at its core it'll have this great story about dreamers trying to make it and friendship.\""
"Paragraph: James Franco plays Wiseau, who wrote, produced, directed and starred in \"The Room.\" When the movie premiered in 2003, it was labeled as perhaps one of the worst movies ever made. However, the film would go on to become a cult classic and central to Sestero's 2013 memoir."
"Paragraph: Dave Franco stars as Sestero in a cast that includes his wife, Alison Brie, Josh Hutcherson, Ari Graynor and Paul Scheer, among others. "
"Paragraph: \"I would say every job I've ever not gotten is an example of that,\" Brie joked about turning perceived failures into success. \"You look back at jobs that you lost sleep over [not getting] and shed tears over, and you realize if you got that, you wouldn't have gotten something else that changed your life.\""
"Paragraph: As Sugar Lyn Beard — who plays two characters in the film —put it, \"Failure doesn't exist.\""
"Paragraph: \"As long as you're trying and putting passion behind it, even if it doesn't go the way that other people think it should've, that's not failure because you learn from that,\" she said. "
"Paragraph: And as will be the case of every red carpet as award season kicks into high gear, the conversation turned to the deluge of sexual assault allegations shaking Hollywood. "
"Paragraph: \"I just hope that as we move forward that men and everyone in our industry takes note of what's going on and changes that type of behavior,\" Graynor said. "
"Paragraph: Hutcherson added: \"It's something that's horrible and embarrassing and disgusting. It's really great and amazing that women are coming forward and we can enact some change and those people that are causing harm and pain to others can be brought to justice.\""
"Paragraph: \"The Disaster Artist\" opens in theaters Dec. 1. "
"Paragraph: For the record"
"Paragraph: 8:15 a.m.: An earlier version of this article credited Alison Brie with an Oscar win for 2015's \"Room.\" The best actress Academy Award went to Brie Larson. "
"Paragraph: Indies are the place to go. I think actors are just starting to feel like we'll go anywhere to do our craft, if it's on TV or an indie. I think we just want to act in good things that have something to say. When we do crap, we want it to be great crap like 'Sharknado.' That is great crap."

"Paragraph: The American Film Institute announced Sunday that \"Molly's Game\" will replace \"All the Money in the World\" as the festival's closer Thursday in the wake of mounting allegations of sexual misconduct against Kevin Spacey. "
"Paragraph: \"Aaron Sorkin is an American master, and we are proud to shine a proper spotlight on his directorial debut, 'Molly's Game,' on AFI Fest's closing night,\" AFI Fest director Jacqueline Lyanga said in a press release. \"As Sorkin embarks on the next chapter of his career, his talents are timely for a tribute as he brings his gift of crafting compelling narratives and complex characters to the story of female impresario Molly Bloom.\""
"Paragraph: The originally scheduled closing night premiere of \"All the Money in the World\" was canceled Monday following the controversy surrounding Spacey. Directed by Ridley Scott, the film was to feature Spacey as oil tycoon J. Paul Getty in the telling of the 1973 kidnapping of his grandson, John Paul Getty III. But Scott decided to cut out Spacey and replace him with Christopher Plummer. Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg also star."
"Paragraph: \"Molly's Game,\" distributed by STX Entertainment, was already scheduled to play at the festival but will now receive a higher-profile slot on the program as well as a tribute to Sorkin and a moderated discussion about his work. "
"Paragraph: The film stars Jessica Chastain as Bloom, an Olympic-class skier who ran the world's most exclusive high-stakes poker game for a decade before being arrested. Idris Elba, Kevin Costner, Michael Cera and Chris O'Dowd also star. "
"Paragraph: A statement released Monday by Sony’s TriStar Pictures read, \"'All the Money in the World' is a superb film and more than worthy of its place of honor in the AFI Fest. But given the current allegations surrounding one of its actors and out of respect for those impacted, it would be inappropriate to celebrate at a gala at this difficult time. Accordingly, the film will be withdrawn."
"Paragraph: \"However, a film is not the work of one person,\" it added. \"There are over 800 other actors, writers, artists, craftspeople and crew who worked tirelessly and ethically on this film, some for years, including one of cinema’s master directors. It would be a gross injustice to punish all of them for the wrongdoings of one supporting actor in the film. Accordingly, the film will open wide as planned on December 22.\""
"Paragraph: Warner Bros. confirmed it has suspended Andrew Kreisberg, an executive producer on The CW's \"Arrow,\" \"Supergirl,\" \"The Flash\" and \"DC's Legends of Tomorrow,\" after opening an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment."
"Paragraph: The allegations by 19 unnamed sources, including 15 women and four men, appeared Friday in Variety and detailed a pattern of misconduct over a period of years. According to Variety the sources chose to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. Kreisberg has denied the allegations, which include frequent touching without permission, asking for massages from female staff members and sexualized comments about women's appearances."
"Paragraph: Berlanti Productions, which oversees Kreisberg's shows, issued a statement signed by heads Greg Berlanti and Sarah Schechter stating, \"We were recently made aware of some deeply troubling allegations regarding one of our showrunners. We have been encouraging and fully cooperating with the investigation into this by Warner Bros."
"Paragraph: \"There is nothing more important to us than the safety and well-being of our cast, crew, writers, producers and any staff. We do not tolerate harassment and are committed to doing everything we can to make an environment that’s safe to work in and safe to speak up about if it isn’t.\""
"Paragraph: Warner Bros. Television Group also issued a statement that read, \"We have recently been made aware of allegations of misconduct against Andrew Kreisberg. We have suspended Mr. Kreisberg and are conducting an internal investigation.  We take all allegations of misconduct extremely seriously, and are committed to creating a safe working environment for our employees and everyone involved in our productions.\""

"Paragraph: I feel like there’s so many facets to L.A., and I’m always discovering new ones, which is why I stay there. I feel lucky to be able to make movies that reflect that."
"Paragraph: FROM THE ARCHIVES: Q&A: Ryan Gosling, the tortured heartthrob of 'La La Land'"
"Paragraph: What's unspoken, the way we talk around things, how our actions are inconsistent with what we're feeling, how anger and affection manifest themselves in strange ways at inappropriate times. If you can bring that to the screen, it has much more resonance than a lot of films."
"Paragraph: FROM THE ARCHIVES: Directing His Trust in Pause and Effect"
"Paragraph: Corey Haim's mother on Friday dismissed a report that linked her late son to actor Charlie Sheen, then pointed an accusing finger back at Dominick Brascia, the former child actor who told a tabloid this week that Sheen had once abused Haim.  "
"Paragraph: \"This guy Dominick is the guy that abused my son,\" Judy Haim told Dr. Mehmet Oz on Friday on \"The Dr. Oz Show.\" She blamed actor-turned-musician Corey Feldman for introducing her son to Brascia and to drugs.  "
"Paragraph: Brascia, she said, has \"made up a lot of stories\" but knows what really happened. The \"Friday the 13th: A New Beginning\" actor was the main named source quoted in a National Enquirer story alleging that Sheen had raped Corey Haim on the set of their 1986 movie, \"Lucas,\" when the younger actor was 13."
"Paragraph: Sheen has \"categorically denied\" the allegations in the Enquirer story, which was published Wednesday. His attorney did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Corey Haim died of pneumonia in 2010."
"Paragraph: The former teen idol was abused \"one time, in Dominick's house,\" according to his mother. She said Brascia lived nearby and a number of boys would hang out there to play pool and watch TV. She said her son was not raped but allegedly had \"a form of sex\" with Brascia. Oz pointed out that what she had whispered in his ear was an illegal act with a minor. "
"Paragraph: Brascia did not immediately respond to an email request from The Times for comment on Judy Haim's allegations; Oz said on the show that Brascia hadn't responded to their requests either. "
"Paragraph: Feldman, the other half of TV's \"The Two Coreys\" reality show, went on \"The Dr. Oz Show\" last week and identified a man he said was one of a number of men who abused him when he was a teen. He also talked to the Los Angeles Police Dept., but the LAPD said Thursday that the statute of limitations had run out on the alleged incident. "
"Paragraph: Feldman is scheduled Monday to come back to \"The Dr. Oz Show\" with more names and details from his own experience as a teen. "
"Paragraph: In a scene from \"The Two Coreys,\" which ran for two seasons in 2007 and 2008, Haim and Feldman both talked about being sexually abused by different people when they were 14, with Haim lighting into Feldman for continuing to hang out with Haim's alleged abuser."
"Paragraph: FX Networks has severed ties with Louis C.K. following the New York Times' bombshell investigation that detailed years of sexual misconduct by the comedian."
"Paragraph: The cable network, which airs four comedies C.K. produces, ended its professional relationship with the Emmy-winning comic after five women came forward Thursday with accusations that C.K. behaved inappropriately with them — allegations that he admitted on Friday were true."
"Paragraph: Several of C.K.'s other projects were canceled — including his upcoming film \"I Love You, Daddy,\" a Netflix stand-up special and a charity appearance on HBO — in the wake of the scandal."
"Paragraph: Also on Friday, his longtime management company, 3 Arts, dropped him."
"Paragraph: \"We have terminated our relationship with Louis C.K.,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are doing a full internal review regarding this situation and are taking additional steps to strengthen our processes and procedures while engaging with our staff to address any concerns about harassment or abuse of power. This behavior is totally unacceptable in all circumstances and must be confronted and addressed.\""
"Paragraph: C.K.'s publicist, Lewis Kay, also parted ways with the beleaguered comedian."
"Paragraph: Here is FX's full statement:"
"Paragraph: \"Today, FX Networks and FX Productions are ending our association with Louis C.K. We are cancelling the overall deal between FX Productions and his production company, Pig Newton. He will no longer serve as executive producer or receive compensation on any of the four shows we were producing with him – \"Better Things,\" \"Baskets,\" \"One Mississippi\" and \"The Cops.\""
"Paragraph: Louis has now confirmed the truth of the reports relating to the five women victimized by his misconduct, which we were unaware of previously. As far as we know, his behavior over the past 8 years on all five series he has produced for FX Networks and/or FX Productions has been professional. However, now is not the time for him to make television shows. Now is the time for him to honestly address the women who have come forth to speak about their painful experiences, a process which he began today with his public statement."
"Paragraph: FX Networks and FX Productions remain committed to doing everything we can to ensure that all people work in an environment that is safe, respectful and fair, and we will continue our review of all of these productions to ensure that was and is the case."
"Paragraph: As Hollywood's watershed moment of transparency and sexual misconduct continues, actor Anthony Edwards has written a devastating essay accusing writer and producer Gary Goddard of molesting him as a child."
"Paragraph: A representative for Goddard has denied the claim."
"Paragraph: In Edwards' essay, which he published Friday morning on Medium under the title \"Yes Mom, There is Something Wrong,\" he described his mother asking him about rumors of Goddard being a pedophile and initially he denied it through tears. "
"Paragraph: \"To face that truth was not an option as my sense of self was completely enmeshed in my gang of five friends who were all led by this sick father figure,\" Edwards wrote."
"Paragraph: The \"ER\" actor went on to accuse Goddard, whom he called a \"mentor, teacher and friend,\" of molesting him for years. "
"Paragraph: Goddard's spokesman Sam Singer called the claim \"disturbing.\""
"Paragraph: \"Gary played an important role in helping start Anthony’s acting career and acted as his personal manager,\" Singer said in a statement issued Friday night. \"He has nothing but the greatest respect for Anthony as a person. Gary is saddened by the false allegations.\""
"Paragraph: Beyond his allegations, Edwards relayed personal insight into the experience of survivors and how individuals find healing in the aftermath of trauma. "
"Paragraph: \"The resulting damage to the emotional development of a child is deep and unforgivable,\" Edwards wrote. \"Only after I was able to separate my experience, process it, and put it in its place could I accept this truth: My abuse may always be with me, but it does not own me."
"Paragraph: \"Shame can thrive easily when we are isolated, but it loses its power when people come together to share their common experiences,\" Edwards wrote."
"Paragraph: In his essay, Edwards also claims that he confronted Goddard about the alleged abuse 22 years ago, during a chance encounter in an airport."
"Paragraph: \"He swore to his remorse and said that he had gotten help,\" Edwards wrote. \"I felt a temporary sense of relief.\""
"Paragraph: Temporary, according to Edwards, because of the rage he felt when Goddard's name reappeared in headlines several years ago."
"Paragraph: This is not the first time Goddard has been hit with sexual abuse accusations."
"Paragraph: In 2014, Goddard and \"X-Men\" director Bryan Singer were named in lawsuits alleging that they had sexually abused two different teenage boys. Both suits were voluntarily dismissed."
"Paragraph: Goddard's spokesman said Friday that the legal complaint against his client \"was completely fabricated, and ultimately withdrawn by the complainant and his attorneys.\""
"Paragraph: Representatives for Edwards did not immediately respond to The Times' request for comment Friday morning."
"Paragraph: Read Edwards' full essay here."

"Paragraph: She's no longer on \"The View,\" but that doesn't mean that Rosie O'Donnell doesn't have opinions about the state of Hollywood, pop culture and the world as we know it. "
"Paragraph: O'Donnell stopped by Bravo's \"Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen\" on Thursday and had plenty on her mind, including Meghan McCain's progress on \"The View\" and the Kardashian pregnancies."
"Paragraph: Of particular note were O'Donnell's thoughts on sexual misconduct in the entertainment industry and beyond."
"Paragraph: Cohen asked O'Donnell if she thought that this moment will change the culture of abuse in Hollywood. O'Donnell was hopeful, but also realized the scope was much larger than just Tinseltown. "
"Paragraph: \"I certainly hope so, but it’s not just Hollywood, you know, right? It’s all over the world. It’s every industry. If you were a teacher, if you work in a hospital, this is just a culture of misogyny and patriarchy and also it’s a country of racism,\" O'Donnell said. \"We have to look at the shadow of who we are and where we are now and how do we make all these things work better.\""
"Paragraph: O'Donnell also discussed the surrealism of seeing Donald Trump, with whom the actress has been feuding for years, in the Oval Office."
"Paragraph: \"When he got to be president, it was very trippy,\" O'Donnell said. \"It took me about six months to regain my equilibrium.\""
"Paragraph: \"Is that true?\" Cohen asked."
"Paragraph: \"I felt like I fell through the ice and I was just waiting to resurface,\" O'Donnell responded."

Article Content: Here's what's new and interesting in entertainment and the arts:Sometimes creators just can't help but mess with a good thing. Coca-Cola had New Coke. Garth Brooks had Chris Gaines. And now "Justice League" has its redesigned Amazon costumes. According to pictures posted over the weekend by the film's original director Zack Snyder, Wonder Woman's cronies sport significantly different duds in the new flick than the ones they donned in June's blockbuster smash "Wonder Woman."  The costume updates are leaving some online critics cold and, all things considered, might have done the same for the actresses who wore them. See, unlike the reinforced, torso-covering warrior gear modeled by Robin Wright in the photo above, the Amazons featured in "Justice League" are wearing a little less. More accurately, a lot less.While some of the new costumes provide protection for the women's internal organs, many leave the fighters depending only on their god-like abs of steel for defense.But, you may ask, what of the "Wonder Woman" training scenes, where many Themyscira inhabitants were more casually clad?You're not wrong. But in the narrative of the story, those garments were never intended for battle, where they would be easily ripped to shreds. They were made for sparring.OK, but how about some equal opportunity exploitation?After all, Snyder also made "300," a film not exactly known for its extensive abdominal protection. Is it sexist? Is it disrespectful? Hard to say. The main takeaway from the costume kerfuffle is probably that Snyder doesn't have a firm grip on the purpose of armor. After tweeting on Thursday that he planned to discuss the sexual misconduct allegations against his friend Louis C.K., actor and comedian Marc Maron has followed through on his promise. On the latest episode of his podcast "WTF," Maron unpacked his thoughts and feelings about the C.K. accusations and clarified what he knew about the stories beforehand as well as his own experience with unwanted sexual conduct. "He's my friend and it's a difficult position to be in," Maron said. "Because I certainly can't condone anything he did. There was no way to justify it. There's no way to defend it. There's no way to apologize for him about it."Maron moved on to address whether there was culpability for C.K.'s actions, given that rumors about his now-admitted inappropriate behavior had swirled around the comedy community for years."There was a story out there," Maron said, "going back several years. That there were unnamed people in the story. Took place in a hotel room in Aspen. It was always out there but then it would pick up momentum at different times and I would ask him about it."The podcast host and star of Netflix's "GLOW" recalled asking C.K. about the story, if it were true that he made women watch him masturbate, and said that C.K. always denied it. When Maron would suggest C.K. quash the rumor publicly, the "Louie" creator would say, "No, I can't. I can't do that. It'll give it life. It'll give it air."Maron also had thoughts on the empathy required for men to force themselves out of their own head space and into a woman's perspective and the struggle he's had with acknowledging the inherent power dynamic involved in the workplace."In a situation where there's a power dynamic. In a situation where you're not even seeing a person. You're just seeing a person who is there to receive your garbage," Maron said of overcoming "man brain." "It's hard to understand that the power dynamic is real and it exists because things have been the way they've been for a long time."Before the episode was over, Maron also attempted to illustrate the problematic nature of C.K.'s actions to those who may wish to dismiss them on grounds of not being illegal. He shared a story of being a college undergraduate struggling with a philosophy class and finding guidance from the professor, a man he looked up to. Maron described the professor as a "powerful, impactful guy" and said, "I wanted him to acknowledge me as someone who is smart, who is on the right path, who is going to do it."The professor and Maron grabbed dinner one night and afterward, his teacher kissed him. "And my body went into like a paralysis," Maron recalled. "It was almost like a leaving-the-body kind of moment and I could not do anything." Though careful not to suggest his own experience was on the same level as that of the women C.K. targeted, Maron explained what made the encounters so devastating."Well, the big deal is that it's boundary-shattering. It is traumatizing. It is unexpected," he said. "These things — they may not destroy your life. They may not even register in the big picture. But they're stuck there. They're stuck there as trauma."The latest episode of "WTF" can be heard here. Radhika Jones will succeed Graydon Carter as Vanity Fair's editor in chief.The former New York Times books editor will be the magazine's fifth editor in chief since its modern revival in 1983, publisher Condé Nast announced Monday following a report of her appointment that was published over the weekend."There is nothing else out there quite like Vanity Fair," Jones said in a statement.  "It doesn't just reflect our culture — it drives our understanding of it. It can mix high and low, wit and gravitas, powerful narrative and irresistible photography. It has a legacy of influential reporting, unmatchable style and, above all, dedication to its readers. I am honored to succeed Graydon Carter as editor and excited to get to work."Carter, who has served as the magazine's editor since 1992, announced in September that he was stepping down after he feeling that he'd "pretty much accomplished everything" he ever wanted to do.Jones earned a nod of approval from Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor in chief who also serves as Condé Nast's artistic director. Wintour called the newly minted chief "a fearless and brilliant editor whose intelligence and curiosity will define the future of Vanity Fair in the years to come."Jones previously served as deputy managing editor at Time magazine and editorial director of the New York Times' book section. She begins her new gig at Vanity Fair on Dec. 11, overseeing all content development, production and consumer experiences for the magazine's numerous platforms, Condé Nast said.She will also head up the glossy's iconic Oscars party, the fifth annual New Establishment Summit and the brand's 105th anniversary, as well as continue the digital expansion of the mag's new vertical, the Hive.A "Lord of the Rings" TV series is coming to Amazon.The Seattle-based e-commerce giant announced Monday that is has acquired the global television rights to J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy novels. It has given a multiple-season commitment to a TV adaptation slated to debut on its streaming service. The series will be produced by Amazon Studios in cooperation with the Tolkien Estate and Trust, book publisher HarperCollins, and New Line Cinema, a division of Warner Bros. Entertainment behind the film adaptations.The TV adaptation will, according to a press release, "explore new storylines preceding 'The Fellowship of the Ring.'" The deal also allows for potential spinoff series. "'The Lord of the Rings' is a cultural phenomenon that has captured the imagination of generations of fans through literature and the big screen,” said Sharon Tal Yguado, head of scripted series at Amazon Studios. “We are ... thrilled to be taking 'The Lord of the Rings' fans on a new epic journey in Middle-earth.”It makes sense that Amazon would pursue the rights to the fantasy novels. CEO Jeff Bezos has made it known that he wants the streamer to find its own "Game of Thrones." And "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, directed by Peter Jackson and starring Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and Sean Astin among others, grossed nearly $6 billion worldwide. “We are delighted that Amazon, with its longstanding commitment to literature, is the home of the first-ever multi-season television series for 'The Lord of the Rings,'” said Matt Galsor, a representative for the Tolkien Estate and Trust and HarperCollins.Mindy Lahiri's colorful costumes, accessories and a slew of amusing props from "The Mindy Project" are going up for auction to mark the show's series finale. Hulu, Universal Television and ScreenBid are hosting an online auction featuring 45 items from Mindy Kaling's sitcom to celebrate the final episode Tuesday. Items on the block include Mindy's "Microwave Cooking for One" book from Season 1, Danny's chewed pen from Season 2 and Danny and Mindy's wedding invitation set from Season 4, as well as several costumes from the show's six seasons.Opening bids range from $25 to $500. Iconic costumes created by Emmy-nominated costume designer Salvador Perez start at $200.The auction begins Monday at 9 p.m. Pacific Time (midnight on the East Coast) and ends Nov. 27. Ten specific items will be auctioned to benefit the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. Browsing through Mindy's closet now. Later, baby.John Oliver didn't have much time to spare on Sunday night's Season 4 finale of "Last Week Tonight," giving the bulk of the episode over to dissecting the twisted behemoth that is the Trump presidency.But the "Daily Show" alumni did carve out a moment to savage the recently exposed Louis C.K. sexual misconduct scandal with just a few brief lines."We saw everything from Republicans continuing to roll out their tax reform plan, with all the grace of a horse falling down a spiral staircase," Oliver said of the past week, "to the New York Times reporting Louis C.K.’s gross sexual misconduct."That would be conduct which, according to Oliver, "is completely indefensible and which inevitably resulted in the cancellation of his new film, 'Exhibit A If This Ever Goes to Trial.'"Oliver was referring to C.K.'s unreleased film "I Love You, Daddy," a black-and-white effort that many critics view as a blatant homage to the work of Woody Allen, that dissects the power imbalance implicit between young women and older men. On Thursday, the New York Times published the stories of five women who accused C.K. of masturbating in front of them —  or asking if he could. On Friday, C.K. admitted that the incidents were true.Even before C.K. verified the accusations were accurate, the distributor for "I Love You, Daddy," the Orchard, announced that it would not move forward with the release of the film. The entirety of this week's episode of "Last Week Tonight With John Oliver" can be seen on HBO Go.Taylor Swift's long-awaited "Reputation" is already assured to be one of the best-selling album launches in recent history. Now the singer has a stadium tour to go with it.Swift announced the first round of U.S. dates for her "Reputation" tour on Monday morning. It is set to begin May 9 in Arizona, and includes a Rose Bowl show May 19. It is scheduled to wrap up in Texas in October. This tour will make use of Ticketmaster's Verified Fan program, the groundbreaking if controversial effort with which fans can boost their place in the ticket-buying line (and hopefully beat scalpers) by purchasing albums and merchandise and sharing Swift content on social media.The effort already seems to have worked in one respect: Last week, "Reputation" sold an estimated 700,000 albums — that's sales alone, not even streaming equivalents — on its first day of release.Carrie Underwood, who broke her wrist Friday, says she'll be all right given a little time to heal. The country singer, who last week co-hosted the CMA Awards for the 10th year, fell on the steps outside her Nashville home Friday, according to the Tennessean. In addition to the wrist injury, she was treated at a hospital for cuts and bruises, her representative told the paper. "Thanks so much for all the well wishes everybody...I’ll be alright...might just take some time...glad I’ve got the best hubby in the world to take care of me," Underwood tweeted on Sunday.Mike Fisher, her husband since 2010, flew home overnight to be with her, according to People. CMAs co-host Brad Paisley also wished her a swift recovery.Unfortunately, she wasn't able to take part in Sunday's Country Rising benefit concert to assist victims of the Las Vegas shooting and help with hurricane recovery. "Supergirl" star Melissa Benoist has spoken out in the wake of sexual harassment accusations against co-showrunner Andrew Kreisberg, who has been suspended pending an investigation by Warner Bros. "I am a woman who leads a show that supports equality and feminism, empowerment and fighting for what is right. I have always tried to conduct myself this way personally, as well," Benoist said in a statement posted Sunday night on Twitter. "Sadly, the show and my career are a part of an industry that doesn't always mirror these sentiments."In a Variety story Friday, 15 women and four men detailed years of alleged misconduct by Kreisberg, including frequent touching without permission, asking for massages from female staff members and sexualized comments about women's appearances.Kreisberg has denied the accusations. Warner Bros. is conducting an investigation with the cooperation of Berlanti Productions, which oversees the producer's shows. Variety said its sources chose to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation.Benoist didn't directly mention Kreisberg — who serves as an executive producer on The CW's "Arrow," "The Flash" and "DC's Legends of Tomorrow" in addition to "Supergirl" — but addressed the atmosphere of the aftermath of allegations against him."This is heartbreaking, and at times makes me feel helpless. I know I’m not the only one who feels this way," she wrote. "But I’m an optimist. I believe lasting change is possible, and when people are mistreated, they should have a safe forum to speak their trust and always be heard." She continued: "And when people commit crimes or harass others they should always be held accountable — no matter what industry they work in or how much power they wield."Benoist then moved to advocate that people, including herself, should continue speaking up in the face of wrongdoing and to hold themselves to a higher standard."So this week, I’ll head back to work on Supergirl even more committed to being a part of changing the norm by listening when people speak up, and refusing to accept an environment that is anything less than a safe, respectful and collaborative space," she concluded.The third season of "Supergirl" is airing on the CW. It premiered on CBS in 2015 and moved to its current home for its second cycle. Failure is not always failure. That was the resounding message from the L.A. premiere of "The Disaster Artist" at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. James and Dave Franco and Seth Rogen were among the stars on hand Sunday to celebrate a film that chronicles the creation of director Tommy Wisea's 2003 movie "The Room.""I love Hollywood stories," said James Franco, who along with his brother read actor Greg Sestero's book "The Disaster Artist" and decided to make it into a movie."This was unlike any Hollywood story I'd ever heard of and read about," said James Franco, who directed and produced the movie. "I read the book and thought this would be so unusual and weird, but at its core it'll have this great story about dreamers trying to make it and friendship."James Franco plays Wiseau, who wrote, produced, directed and starred in "The Room." When the movie premiered in 2003, it was labeled as perhaps one of the worst movies ever made. However, the film would go on to become a cult classic and central to Sestero's 2013 memoir.Dave Franco stars as Sestero in a cast that includes his wife, Alison Brie, Josh Hutcherson, Ari Graynor and Paul Scheer, among others. "I would say every job I've ever not gotten is an example of that," Brie joked about turning perceived failures into success. "You look back at jobs that you lost sleep over [not getting] and shed tears over, and you realize if you got that, you wouldn't have gotten something else that changed your life."As Sugar Lyn Beard — who plays two characters in the film —put it, "Failure doesn't exist.""As long as you're trying and putting passion behind it, even if it doesn't go the way that other people think it should've, that's not failure because you learn from that," she said. And as will be the case of every red carpet as award season kicks into high gear, the conversation turned to the deluge of sexual assault allegations shaking Hollywood. "I just hope that as we move forward that men and everyone in our industry takes note of what's going on and changes that type of behavior," Graynor said. Hutcherson added: "It's something that's horrible and embarrassing and disgusting. It's really great and amazing that women are coming forward and we can enact some change and those people that are causing harm and pain to others can be brought to justice.""The Disaster Artist" opens in theaters Dec. 1. For the record8:15 a.m.: An earlier version of this article credited Alison Brie with an Oscar win for 2015's "Room." The best actress Academy Award went to Brie Larson. Indies are the place to go. I think actors are just starting to feel like we'll go anywhere to do our craft, if it's on TV or an indie. I think we just want to act in good things that have something to say. When we do crap, we want it to be great crap like 'Sharknado.' That is great crap.FROM THE ARCHIVES: Whoopi Goldberg talks about plum role in 'Big Stone Gap'The American Film Institute announced Sunday that "Molly's Game" will replace "All the Money in the World" as the festival's closer Thursday in the wake of mounting allegations of sexual misconduct against Kevin Spacey. "Aaron Sorkin is an American master, and we are proud to shine a proper spotlight on his directorial debut, 'Molly's Game,' on AFI Fest's closing night," AFI Fest director Jacqueline Lyanga said in a press release. "As Sorkin embarks on the next chapter of his career, his talents are timely for a tribute as he brings his gift of crafting compelling narratives and complex characters to the story of female impresario Molly Bloom."The originally scheduled closing night premiere of "All the Money in the World" was canceled Monday following the controversy surrounding Spacey. Directed by Ridley Scott, the film was to feature Spacey as oil tycoon J. Paul Getty in the telling of the 1973 kidnapping of his grandson, John Paul Getty III. But Scott decided to cut out Spacey and replace him with Christopher Plummer. Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg also star."Molly's Game," distributed by STX Entertainment, was already scheduled to play at the festival but will now receive a higher-profile slot on the program as well as a tribute to Sorkin and a moderated discussion about his work. The film stars Jessica Chastain as Bloom, an Olympic-class skier who ran the world's most exclusive high-stakes poker game for a decade before being arrested. Idris Elba, Kevin Costner, Michael Cera and Chris O'Dowd also star. A statement released Monday by Sony’s TriStar Pictures read, "'All the Money in the World' is a superb film and more than worthy of its place of honor in the AFI Fest. But given the current allegations surrounding one of its actors and out of respect for those impacted, it would be inappropriate to celebrate at a gala at this difficult time. Accordingly, the film will be withdrawn."However, a film is not the work of one person," it added. "There are over 800 other actors, writers, artists, craftspeople and crew who worked tirelessly and ethically on this film, some for years, including one of cinema’s master directors. It would be a gross injustice to punish all of them for the wrongdoings of one supporting actor in the film. Accordingly, the film will open wide as planned on December 22."Warner Bros. confirmed it has suspended Andrew Kreisberg, an executive producer on The CW's "Arrow," "Supergirl," "The Flash" and "DC's Legends of Tomorrow," after opening an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment.The allegations by 19 unnamed sources, including 15 women and four men, appeared Friday in Variety and detailed a pattern of misconduct over a period of years. According to Variety the sources chose to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. Kreisberg has denied the allegations, which include frequent touching without permission, asking for massages from female staff members and sexualized comments about women's appearances.Berlanti Productions, which oversees Kreisberg's shows, issued a statement signed by heads Greg Berlanti and Sarah Schechter stating, "We were recently made aware of some deeply troubling allegations regarding one of our showrunners. We have been encouraging and fully cooperating with the investigation into this by Warner Bros."There is nothing more important to us than the safety and well-being of our cast, crew, writers, producers and any staff. We do not tolerate harassment and are committed to doing everything we can to make an environment that’s safe to work in and safe to speak up about if it isn’t."Warner Bros. Television Group also issued a statement that read, "We have recently been made aware of allegations of misconduct against Andrew Kreisberg. We have suspended Mr. Kreisberg and are conducting an internal investigation.  We take all allegations of misconduct extremely seriously, and are committed to creating a safe working environment for our employees and everyone involved in our productions." I feel like there’s so many facets to L.A., and I’m always discovering new ones, which is why I stay there. I feel lucky to be able to make movies that reflect that.FROM THE ARCHIVES: Q&A: Ryan Gosling, the tortured heartthrob of 'La La Land'What's unspoken, the way we talk around things, how our actions are inconsistent with what we're feeling, how anger and affection manifest themselves in strange ways at inappropriate times. If you can bring that to the screen, it has much more resonance than a lot of films.FROM THE ARCHIVES: Directing His Trust in Pause and EffectCorey Haim's mother on Friday dismissed a report that linked her late son to actor Charlie Sheen, then pointed an accusing finger back at Dominick Brascia, the former child actor who told a tabloid this week that Sheen had once abused Haim.  "This guy Dominick is the guy that abused my son," Judy Haim told Dr. Mehmet Oz on Friday on "The Dr. Oz Show." She blamed actor-turned-musician Corey Feldman for introducing her son to Brascia and to drugs.  Brascia, she said, has "made up a lot of stories" but knows what really happened. The "Friday the 13th: A New Beginning" actor was the main named source quoted in a National Enquirer story alleging that Sheen had raped Corey Haim on the set of their 1986 movie, "Lucas," when the younger actor was 13.Sheen has "categorically denied" the allegations in the Enquirer story, which was published Wednesday. His attorney did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Corey Haim died of pneumonia in 2010.The former teen idol was abused "one time, in Dominick's house," according to his mother. She said Brascia lived nearby and a number of boys would hang out there to play pool and watch TV. She said her son was not raped but allegedly had "a form of sex" with Brascia. Oz pointed out that what she had whispered in his ear was an illegal act with a minor. Brascia did not immediately respond to an email request from The Times for comment on Judy Haim's allegations; Oz said on the show that Brascia hadn't responded to their requests either. Feldman, the other half of TV's "The Two Coreys" reality show, went on "The Dr. Oz Show" last week and identified a man he said was one of a number of men who abused him when he was a teen. He also talked to the Los Angeles Police Dept., but the LAPD said Thursday that the statute of limitations had run out on the alleged incident. Feldman is scheduled Monday to come back to "The Dr. Oz Show" with more names and details from his own experience as a teen. In a scene from "The Two Coreys," which ran for two seasons in 2007 and 2008, Haim and Feldman both talked about being sexually abused by different people when they were 14, with Haim lighting into Feldman for continuing to hang out with Haim's alleged abuser.FX Networks has severed ties with Louis C.K. following the New York Times' bombshell investigation that detailed years of sexual misconduct by the comedian.The cable network, which airs four comedies C.K. produces, ended its professional relationship with the Emmy-winning comic after five women came forward Thursday with accusations that C.K. behaved inappropriately with them — allegations that he admitted on Friday were true.Several of C.K.'s other projects were canceled — including his upcoming film "I Love You, Daddy," a Netflix stand-up special and a charity appearance on HBO — in the wake of the scandal.Also on Friday, his longtime management company, 3 Arts, dropped him."We have terminated our relationship with Louis C.K.," the company said in a statement. "We are doing a full internal review regarding this situation and are taking additional steps to strengthen our processes and procedures while engaging with our staff to address any concerns about harassment or abuse of power. This behavior is totally unacceptable in all circumstances and must be confronted and addressed."C.K.'s publicist, Lewis Kay, also parted ways with the beleaguered comedian.Here is FX's full statement:"Today, FX Networks and FX Productions are ending our association with Louis C.K. We are cancelling the overall deal between FX Productions and his production company, Pig Newton. He will no longer serve as executive producer or receive compensation on any of the four shows we were producing with him – "Better Things," "Baskets," "One Mississippi" and "The Cops."Louis has now confirmed the truth of the reports relating to the five women victimized by his misconduct, which we were unaware of previously. As far as we know, his behavior over the past 8 years on all five series he has produced for FX Networks and/or FX Productions has been professional. However, now is not the time for him to make television shows. Now is the time for him to honestly address the women who have come forth to speak about their painful experiences, a process which he began today with his public statement.FX Networks and FX Productions remain committed to doing everything we can to ensure that all people work in an environment that is safe, respectful and fair, and we will continue our review of all of these productions to ensure that was and is the case.As Hollywood's watershed moment of transparency and sexual misconduct continues, actor Anthony Edwards has written a devastating essay accusing writer and producer Gary Goddard of molesting him as a child.A representative for Goddard has denied the claim.In Edwards' essay, which he published Friday morning on Medium under the title "Yes Mom, There is Something Wrong," he described his mother asking him about rumors of Goddard being a pedophile and initially he denied it through tears. "To face that truth was not an option as my sense of self was completely enmeshed in my gang of five friends who were all led by this sick father figure," Edwards wrote.The "ER" actor went on to accuse Goddard, whom he called a "mentor, teacher and friend," of molesting him for years. Goddard's spokesman Sam Singer called the claim "disturbing.""Gary played an important role in helping start Anthony’s acting career and acted as his personal manager," Singer said in a statement issued Friday night. "He has nothing but the greatest respect for Anthony as a person. Gary is saddened by the false allegations."Beyond his allegations, Edwards relayed personal insight into the experience of survivors and how individuals find healing in the aftermath of trauma. "The resulting damage to the emotional development of a child is deep and unforgivable," Edwards wrote. "Only after I was able to separate my experience, process it, and put it in its place could I accept this truth: My abuse may always be with me, but it does not own me."Shame can thrive easily when we are isolated, but it loses its power when people come together to share their common experiences," Edwards wrote.In his essay, Edwards also claims that he confronted Goddard about the alleged abuse 22 years ago, during a chance encounter in an airport."He swore to his remorse and said that he had gotten help," Edwards wrote. "I felt a temporary sense of relief."Temporary, according to Edwards, because of the rage he felt when Goddard's name reappeared in headlines several years ago.This is not the first time Goddard has been hit with sexual abuse accusations.In 2014, Goddard and "X-Men" director Bryan Singer were named in lawsuits alleging that they had sexually abused two different teenage boys. Both suits were voluntarily dismissed.Goddard's spokesman said Friday that the legal complaint against his client "was completely fabricated, and ultimately withdrawn by the complainant and his attorneys."Representatives for Edwards did not immediately respond to The Times' request for comment Friday morning.Read Edwards' full essay here.8:06 p.m.: This post was updated with a statement from Goddard's spokesman denying Edwards' claim.This post was originally published at 1:48 p.m.She's no longer on "The View," but that doesn't mean that Rosie O'Donnell doesn't have opinions about the state of Hollywood, pop culture and the world as we know it. O'Donnell stopped by Bravo's "Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen" on Thursday and had plenty on her mind, including Meghan McCain's progress on "The View" and the Kardashian pregnancies.Of particular note were O'Donnell's thoughts on sexual misconduct in the entertainment industry and beyond.Cohen asked O'Donnell if she thought that this moment will change the culture of abuse in Hollywood. O'Donnell was hopeful, but also realized the scope was much larger than just Tinseltown. "I certainly hope so, but it’s not just Hollywood, you know, right? It’s all over the world. It’s every industry. If you were a teacher, if you work in a hospital, this is just a culture of misogyny and patriarchy and also it’s a country of racism," O'Donnell said. "We have to look at the shadow of who we are and where we are now and how do we make all these things work better."O'Donnell also discussed the surrealism of seeing Donald Trump, with whom the actress has been feuding for years, in the Oval Office."When he got to be president, it was very trippy," O'Donnell said. "It took me about six months to regain my equilibrium.""Is that true?" Cohen asked."I felt like I fell through the ice and I was just waiting to resurface," O'Donnell responded.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced Friday that 26 animated features have been submitted for Oscar consideration. The submissions include "Despicable Me 3," "The Boss Baby" and "Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie," as well as several pictures that have yet to be released, including Disney's "Coco" and Sony's "The Star."For the first time, voting for nominations in the animated feature film category is open to the entire eligible voting membership of the academy. Nominations will be announced Jan. 23.  Here's the full list of contenders:

"Paragraph: As Republicans race to enact a tax overhaul this year, most of the focus has been on the cost of the cuts over the next decade. Under Senate instructions, the package can’t add more than $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years."
"Paragraph: But the biggest hurdle to passing a tax bill could be what happens in year 11."
"Paragraph: An arcane Senate provision known as the Byrd rule requires that any bill approved by the Senate by a simple majority vote using the budget reconciliation process must not increase the deficit after 10 years."
"Paragraph: With near universal Democratic opposition, Senate Republicans need to use reconciliation to pass a tax bill. That means any tax package must not only fall below the $1.5 trillion threshold for the first decade, it must pay for itself after that."
"Paragraph: And although House and Senate Republicans are confident they can meet the initial 10-year target, no one is quite sure how to comply with the Byrd rule, short of possibly having the long-coveted tax cuts expire after 10 years, as has happened before."
"Paragraph: If Republicans don’t find a solution, Senate Democrats could use the rule to try to prevent them from using the reconciliation process. That would require Republicans to have 60 votes for a tax bill rather than 50, assuming Vice President Mike Pence breaks a tie."
"Paragraph: No congressional analysis has been done yet of the budgetary impact of the Senate Republican tax bill in 2028."
"Paragraph: But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that the House bill would add about $155 billion to the deficit in 2028, violating the Byrd rule."
"Paragraph: And based on congressional number-crunching already done for 2018-27, the Senate bill would most likely add to the deficit in 2028, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative-leaning American Action Forum economic think tank and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office."
"Paragraph: “They have a problem in the Senate,” Holtz-Eakin said of Republicans."
"Paragraph: The Senate Republican bill would increase the deficit by $167 billion in 2026 and $217 billion in 2027, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation."
"Paragraph: Those large budget deficits won’t “magically go away” in 2028, Holtz-Eakin said."
"Paragraph: Republicans have predicted that the tax cuts will promote so much economic growth that all costs will be offset by new revenue. But history has shown that hasn’t happened and such optimistic projections may not be enough to satisfy the Byrd rule."
"Paragraph: In 2001, Republicans got around the Byrd rule problem by having major individual tax cuts pushed by President George W. Bush expire after 10 years."
"Paragraph: “Literally, all we could do was just sunset the provisions after 10 years or otherwise we would have jeopardized the whole bill,” said G. William Hoagland, who worked for the Senate Budget Committee at the time and now is senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank."
"Paragraph: But President Trump, key Republicans and major business groups are pushing for the corporate tax cuts now being proposed to be permanent."
"Paragraph: Also, a 10-year expiration might not work this time. The Joint Committee on Taxation said in April that cutting the corporate tax rate to 20% even for just three years — from 2018-20 — would lead to lower federal revenue for several years afterward."
"Paragraph: Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who drafted the Senate bill, acknowledged the Byrd rule challenge. “The House has to understand that we have to comply with the Byrd rule…I think they understand that we have difficulties,” Hatch told reporters Thursday."
"Paragraph: Asked how he would resolve the problem, Hatch said, “You’ll have to wait and see. We’re working on that as we speak. It’s not an easy thing.”"
"Paragraph: It’s just one of the obstacles for Republicans as the House pushes toward a vote on its bill this week and the Senate Finance Committee began considering its own legislation on Monday."
"Paragraph: Trump reinserted himself into the tax debate with requests for additional changes that congressional Republican leaders already have rejected because of their cost or a lack of party support."
"Paragraph: In a tweet Monday, Trump suggested that the top individual tax rate be reduced to 35% from the 39.6% level in the House bill and 38.5% in the Senate bill. And Trump wants the legislation to repeal the mandate in the Affordable Care Act that all Americans have health insurance."
"Paragraph: The bills are centered on a big reduction in the corporate tax rate and a change in individual tax brackets as well as the scrapping or scaling back of some popular deductions for individuals. There are key differences between the House and Senate bills that would have to be resolved."
"Paragraph: Holtz-Eakin suggested that Republicans could try to resolve the Byrd rule problem by proposing some sort of tax increase that would take effect in 2028 that would offset any deficit problem that year. Republicans then would have 10 years to figure out another solution before the tax increase hit, he said."
"Paragraph: “It solves their problem on paper but they would hope [the tax increase] never happens,” he said."

"Paragraph: NHL still looking overseas"
"Paragraph: Speaking before the Colorado Avalanche and Ottawa Senators played two games in Stockholm, Commissioner Gary Bettman outlined his plan for expanding the game outside North America. “The vision and hope is to establish a more regular and predictable presence for our international events,” he said. The NHL had that “regular and predictable presence” when players represented their homelands at five Winter Olympics, but the man who canceled one season and shortened two others during league-imposed lockouts said he didn’t want to disrupt the season for the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in February. National pride was a powerful motivation for players at the Olympics and they wanted to return; traveling to Europe for a couple of weekend games is less compelling. This positions Bettman to use participation in the 2022 Olympics in Beijing as a bargaining chip to get concessions in the next labor negotiations with the NHL Players’ Assn."
"Paragraph: Maple Leafs, Marner end slumps"
"Paragraph: Forward Mitch Marner, who produced 19 goals and 61 points as a rookie last season, scored a goal in Toronto’s opener this season but was blanked for 17 games until Saturday, when the Maple Leafs completed a home-and-home sweep of the Boston Bruins. The Maple Leafs have a four-game winning streak even though Auston Matthews, last season’s rookie of the year, has missed the last three games because of an upper-body injury."
"Paragraph: The Jets are soaring"
"Paragraph: Winnipeg has been an early surprise, sitting in second place in the Central division at 9-4-3. The Jets have earned points in nine of their last 10 games (6-1-3) and have two scorers in the league’s top 10. Blake Wheeler (five goals, 23 points) ranked third through Sunday’s games, and Mark Scheifele (10 goals, 21 points) ranked seventh. More important, according to Wheeler, is the team’s resilience. The Jets followed a weak effort in a loss at Las Vegas on Friday by rallying to beat the Arizona Coyotes on Saturday. “No matter how good a team you are, you’re going to have games like that. The key is how are you going to come back from that,” Wheeler told the Winnipeg Sun. “That’s the biggest growth from our team. You get rid of the bad ones and come ready to play the next game.”"
"Paragraph: Understudy is becoming a star in Montreal"
"Paragraph: The Canadiens called up Charlie Lindgren on Nov. 3 as insurance after No. 1 goaltender Carey Price sustained a lower-body injury. But when Al Montoya suffered a concussion, the Canadiens had to turn to Lindgren and he has handed the pressure well. In four straight starts the 23-year-old Minnesotan is 3-1-0 with a 1.24 goals-against average and .964 save percentage. “He puts in the work, and when guys see that, they want to work hard to help him,” forward Max Pacioretty told the Montreal Gazette."
"Paragraph: The Rangers have revived"
"Paragraph: After stumbling through a 1-5-2 start the New York Rangers have turned things around and have won six straight games. Their power play (nine for 23 over the last seven games) has provided a lift, with defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk as the catalyst. He has points in seven straight games."

But when Al Montoya suffered a concussion, the Canadiens had to turn to Lindgren and he has handed the pressure well. In four straight starts the 23-year-old Minnesotan is 3-1-0 with a 1.24 goals-against average and .964 save percentage. “He puts in the work, and when guys see that, they want to work hard to help him,” forward Max Pacioretty told the Montreal Gazette.The Rangers have revivedAfter stumbling through a 1-5-2 start the New York Rangers have turned things around and have won six straight games. Their power play (nine for 23 over the last seven games) has provided a lift, with defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk as the catalyst.

"Paragraph: What do PETA protests, a third date and lingerie have to do with women’s performance golf apparel? A lot if you’re Megan LaMothe, founder of the new Foray Golf label that teed up at Malbon Golf on Fairfax last week, marking its bricks-and-mortar debut in Los Angeles."
"Paragraph: “The daughter of a friend of mine would go around and put these PETA stickers on people that said: ‘I’m an … I wear fur,’ and that made me think of splattering clothes with paint or bleach,” LaMothe said  recently  as she held up the most eye-catching piece in the current collection — a polo shirt in a faded purple plaid pattern heavily blotched with white, bleach-like spatters. As she hung the polo back on the rack with one hand, she pulled out what looked like a traditional blue cardigan sweater with the other, flipping it around to reveal a back panel Op-art design with the silhouette of a vaguely Jeff Koons-ian  balloon dog in the center."
"Paragraph: Just as quickly, LaMothe reracked the cardigan and pulled out a floral skirt with a built-in pair of shorts to highlight two construction details: a hidden back-of-the-hip pocket and the construction of the crotch of the shorts."
"Paragraph: “We call the pocket a ‘sneaky pocket,’” she said, “and it’s a place for a woman to put her cellphone where it doesn’t look like this huge, unsightly bulge sticking out of a side pocket. And the crotch of the shorts uses a channel gusset construction to eliminate the fabric-bunching and skin-chafing that happen because women’s bodies are shaped differently from men’s.”"
"Paragraph: Although she describes herself as a first-generation golfer (she took her first swing on her third date with her now husband), LaMothe knows a thing or two about fitting women’s bodies, having spent five years as director of design operations for lingerie maker Victoria’s Secret."
"Paragraph: “I come from the world of lingerie where we obsessed over fit,” LaMothe said, “and how things felt next to the body … and all of the golf clothing [I found] was poorly made and ill-fitting — too long, too short, too tight or too loose.”"
"Paragraph: Upping the comfort level is a four-way stretch jersey nylon/elastane fabric used in most of the sleeveless polos, skirt/shorts, bodysuits and rompers that has moisture-wicking properties augmented by details like the aforementioned channel gusset construction, silicone grippers at the leg openings to keep them from riding up and bonded button plackets on the sleeveless polos to prevent button-gapping."
"Paragraph: Adding a fashion twist to the line of functional golf threads is the limited-production run of each item that ranges from 25 to 250 pieces. The aforementioned Security Bleach polo ($120) was a limited-edition of 225,  for example, and the Ghost Dog cardigan ($130) was produced in a run of just 200 pieces."
"Paragraph: As of last week, Foray Golf is available locally at Malbon Golf in Los Angeles and the  Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks as well as online at foraygolf.com."

"Paragraph: Here's what's new and interesting in entertainment and the arts:"
"Paragraph: After tweeting on Thursday that he planned to discuss the sexual misconduct allegations against his friend Louis C.K., actor and comedian Marc Maron has followed through on his promise. "
"Paragraph: On the latest episode of his podcast \"WTF,\" Maron unpacked his thoughts and feelings about the C.K. accusations and clarified what he knew about the stories beforehand as well as his own experience with unwanted sexual conduct. "
"Paragraph: \"He's my friend and it's a difficult position to be in,\" Maron said. \"Because I certainly can't condone anything he did. There was no way to justify it. There's no way to defend it. There's no way to apologize for him about it.\""
"Paragraph: Maron moved on to address whether there was culpability for C.K.'s actions, given that rumors about his now-admitted inappropriate behavior had swirled around the comedy community for years."
"Paragraph: \"There was a story out there,\" Maron said, \"going back several years. That there were unnamed people in the story. Took place in a hotel room in Aspen. It was always out there but then it would pick up momentum at different times and I would ask him about it.\""
"Paragraph: The podcast host and star of Netflix's \"GLOW\" recalled asking C.K. about the story, if it were true that he made women watch him masturbate, and said that C.K. always denied it. "
"Paragraph: When Maron would suggest C.K. quash the rumor publicly, the \"Louie\" creator would say, \"No, I can't. I can't do that. It'll give it life. It'll give it air.\""
"Paragraph: Maron also had thoughts on the empathy required for men to force themselves out of their own head space and into a woman's perspective and the struggle he's had with acknowledging the inherent power dynamic involved in the workplace."
"Paragraph: \"In a situation where there's a power dynamic. In a situation where you're not even seeing a person. You're just seeing a person who is there to receive your garbage,\" Maron said of overcoming \"man brain.\" \"It's hard to understand that the power dynamic is real and it exists because things have been the way they've been for a long time.\""
"Paragraph: Before the episode was over, Maron also attempted to illustrate the problematic nature of C.K.'s actions to those who may wish to dismiss them on grounds of not being illegal. "
"Paragraph: He shared a story of being a college undergraduate struggling with a philosophy class and finding guidance from the professor, a man he looked up to. "
"Paragraph: Maron described the professor as a \"powerful, impactful guy\" and said, \"I wanted him to acknowledge me as someone who is smart, who is on the right path, who is going to do it.\""
"Paragraph: The professor and Maron grabbed dinner one night and afterward, his teacher kissed him. "
"Paragraph: \"And my body went into like a paralysis,\" Maron recalled. \"It was almost like a leaving-the-body kind of moment and I could not do anything.\" "
"Paragraph: Though careful not to suggest his own experience was on the same level as that of the women C.K. targeted, Maron explained what made the encounters so devastating."
"Paragraph: \"Well, the big deal is that it's boundary-shattering. It is traumatizing. It is unexpected,\" he said. \"These things — they may not destroy your life. They may not even register in the big picture. But they're stuck there. They're stuck there as trauma.\""

"Paragraph: The Supreme Court said Monday it will hear an anti-abortion group’s free-speech challenge to a California law that requires “crisis pregnancy centers” to notify patients that the state offers subsidies for contraception and abortion."
"Paragraph: The challengers say the disclosure law violates the 1st Amendment because it forces the faith-based pregnancy centers to send a message that conflicts with their aim of encouraging childbirth, not abortion."
"Paragraph: It will be the second major case this term in which a conservative, religious-rights plaintiff is challenging a liberal state law on free-speech grounds — and both came from the same lawyers. The Arizona-based Alliance Defending Freedom sued on behalf of a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple and was charged with violating the state’s civil rights law. The justices are due to hear his appeal on Dec. 5."
"Paragraph: ADF lawyers also challenged the California disclosure law on behalf of the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, which describes itself as “a faith-based, Christian ministry that seeks to glorify God by proclaiming the sanctity of human life, both born and unborn.” The group represents 110 pregnancy centers in California, and it contends the disclosure provisions amount to unconstitutional “compelled speech.”"
"Paragraph: The key issue, said Michael Farris, ADL’s president, is whether “California can put its thumb on one side” of the scale and require a faith-based center “to promote a pro-abortion message.”"
"Paragraph: The case presents a clash between the state’s power to regulate the medical profession and the Constitution’s protection for the freedom of speech. Historically, states have had broad authority to regulate physicians and medical providers to protect patients from fraud and sub-standard care. But in recent years, doctors have sued and won claims that state lawmakers had gone too far and were wrongly interfering with the doctor-patient relationship."
"Paragraph: In North Carolina, abortion doctors sued and won a free-speech challenge to a law that would have required them to describe to their patients a sonogram of a developing fetus. In another case, informally dubbed Docs vs. Glocks, physicians in Florida sued successfully to block a state law that would have barred them from asking patients about whether they had guns at home."
"Paragraph: California lawmakers passed the disclosure law two years ago after concluding as many as 200 pregnancy centers in the state sometimes used “intentionally deceptive advertising and counseling practices that often confuse, misinform and even intimidate women” about their options for medical care."
"Paragraph: The law, known as the Reproductive FACT Act, says these centers must disclose whether they have a medical license and have medical professionals available. They must also post a notice in the waiting room that says, “California has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services, including all FDA-approved methods of contraception, pre-natal care and abortion.” The notice includes a phone number for a county social services office."
"Paragraph: Several centers sued to block the disclosure rule, but lost before three federal district judges. Last year, the 9th Circuit Court upheld the law in a 3-0 decision. Judge Dorothy Nelson said the disclosure provision does not “encourage, suggest or imply” that a woman should seek an abortion. It is “closely drawn to achieve California’s interest in safeguarding public health and fully informing Californians of the existence of publicly funded medical services,” she said."
"Paragraph: In their appeal to the Supreme Court, the challengers pointed out that the 2nd Circuit Court had struck down a similar provision in a New York City ordinance."
"Paragraph: The court’s decision to hear the case may reflect the impact of new Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. He had shown a strong interest in religious liberty claims as an appeals court judge. A few weeks after he arrived, the high court announced it would hear the case of the Colorado baker. It takes the vote of four justices to hear an appeal, and five to have a majority. That suggests the outcome in the California case, like the one from Colorado, will turn on the vote of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy."
"Paragraph: California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra vowed to defend the disclosure law. It “ensures that women in California receive accurate information about their health care options,” he said."
"Paragraph: But the state is fighting on two fronts. Last month, a superior court judge in Riverside County ruled the law violated the free-speech provisions of California’s Constitution."
"Paragraph: In addition to NIFLA vs. Becerra, the justices agreed to hear two other free-speech claims on Monday. In Minnesota Voters Alliance vs. Mansky, the court will decide whether states can forbid voters from wearing a “political badge, political button or other political insignia” in a polling place on election day. A tea party leader sued after he was temporarily blocked from voting because he wore a T-shirt that sported a tea party logo and read “Don’t Tread on Me.”"
"Paragraph: In Lozman vs. City of Riviera Beach, the court will decide whether someone who was arrested after refusing to quit talking at a city council meeting can sue for a “retaliatory arrest” in violation of the 1st Amendment. The 11th Circuit in Atlanta said the law puts an “absolute bar” on such claims so long as the police officer had probable cause to arrest the speaker for being disruptive. But the justices voted to hear the appeal of the persistent speaker."

"Paragraph: Warner Bros. finds itself in an awkward situation with Gal Gadot, the star of its most important movie of the year, “Justice League,” which debuts Friday."
"Paragraph: At the center of the issue is the studio’s relationship with embattled filmmaker Brett Ratner, who has been accused by several women of a range of sexual misconduct."
"Paragraph: A widely circulated report published by the New York Post on Saturday said that Gadot, who starred in the summer blockbuster “Wonder Woman,” would not appear in the planned 2019 sequel if Ratner’s financing company, RatPac-Dune Entertainment, were to be involved."
"Paragraph: The company, which has a co-financing or slate deal with Warner Bros. that began in 2013 and covers up to 75 films, helped pay for “Wonder Woman,” along with most other films from the studio in recent years."
"Paragraph: But any alleged ultimatum by Gadot would appear to be a moot point."
"Paragraph: RatPac-Dune’s financing agreement with Warner Bros. expires in spring 2018, and as a result, the existing deal is not expected to include funding part of the “Wonder Woman 2” sequel, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to comment publicly. Warner Bros. announced Monday that the follow-up film would be released Nov. 1, 2019."
"Paragraph: Melissa Raubvogel, Gadot's publicist, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A spokesman for Warner Bros. called the Post story “false” and declined to comment further."
"Paragraph: The last film to be covered by the existing RatPac-Dune deal is likely to be “Rampage,” an action-adventure movie that comes out April 20, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Typically, slate financing deals cover films that are released in theaters within the effective dates of the arrangement."
"Paragraph: After the Los Angeles Times published a Nov. 1 story that detailed allegations by actresses including Olivia Munn, Natasha Henstridge and Jaime Ray Newman, Warner Bros. cut ties with Ratner. The studio chose not to renew its production deal with Ratner’s other company, RatPac Entertainment, and he will no longer keep an office on the studio’s Burbank lot."
"Paragraph: Ratner, through his attorney, Martin Singer, has “categorically” disputed the women’s accounts. But the 48-year-old filmmaker, best known for the “Rush Hour” franchise, said in a statement that he was “choosing to personally step away from all Warner Bros.-related activities.”"
"Paragraph: “I don’t want to have any possible negative impact to the studio until these personal issues are resolved,” he said."
"Paragraph: “Wonder Woman,” which was released in June and grossed more than $820 million worldwide, gave a big boost to Warner Bros. at a time when it was getting pilloried by critics and fans alike for its handling of a series of movies involving DC Comics characters. Films including “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” and “Suicide Squad” underwhelmed critics, though both grossed more than $700 million worldwide."
"Paragraph: Gadot reprises her Wonder Woman role in “Justice League,” which pulls together characters including Batman for a superhero romp that has been compared to Walt Disney Co.’s successful “Avengers” franchise."
"Paragraph: The Post’s story, which appeared in the Page Six column and cited unnamed sources, said Gadot is “tough and stands by her principles.”"
"Paragraph: Gadot already has extricated herself from a Ratner-involved event in recent weeks. She was slated to give a Jewish National Fund award to Ratner in late October, but the actress’ publicist announced she would not appear at the event because of a scheduling conflict."
"Paragraph: Instead, \"Wonder Woman\" director Patty Jenkins, who has known Ratner for years, presented him the award."
"Paragraph: It is unclear what will become of RatPac-Dune’s relationship with Warner Bros. beyond next spring. The company previously included now-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as a principal. It is currently led by Len Blavatnik."
"Paragraph: In April, Blavatnik, a Russian billionaire, bought out another RatPac-Dune principal, the Australian tycoon James Packer. Mnuchin also sold his stake as part of his move into government work."

"Paragraph: Once a darling of the Mojave aerospace start-up scene, spaceplane builder Xcor Aerospace has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy."
"Paragraph: A court document filed last week with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of California says the company has more than 100 creditors and assets estimated between $1 million and $10 million."
"Paragraph: Xcor’s liabilities are estimated in the filing to be between $10 million and $50 million."
"Paragraph: In a message sent last week to investors and company shareholders, Xcor Chief Executive Michael Blum and Chairman Tom Burbage said their effort to “find a financial future for Xcor has not succeeded.”"
"Paragraph: The company said it had had “promising” discussions about potentially joining a consortium led by a “large aerospace firm” that would develop space access capabilities in Britain, and also held extensive talks with several groups of investors who were interested in developing a space tourism business."
"Paragraph: As recently as two weeks ago, a new party had expressed interest in Xcor but “did not have the financial capabilities initially portrayed to us,” the letter states. Ultimately the company said its senior secured creditor became “difficult to work with, necessitating a bankruptcy filing.”"
"Paragraph: “Today it is my sad duty to inform you that Xcor has failed,” the letter states. “I am sorry that XCOR has let you down. I share your disappointment.”"
"Paragraph: Nearly 10 years ago, Xcor unveiled plans for its Lynx suborbital space plane that was intended to take tourists to the edge of space for at least $100,000 a ride."
"Paragraph: The company was seen as a rival to British billionaire Richard Branson’s space tourism start-up, Virgin Galactic, and even got the attention of NASA, which awarded Xcor a contract that did not provide funds but indicated the agency’s interest in eventually purchasing flights from the company to take experiments into suborbital space."
"Paragraph: But Xcor underestimated the project’s complexity and the funding needed to develop the Lynx. Though Xcor also had an engine business, analysts said it did not have a diverse customer base."
"Paragraph: In 2015, Xcor relocated its headquarters from Mojave, Calif. to Midland, Texas. Last year, it said it would suspend construction on the Lynx space plane and laid off 50 to 60 employees — about half of the company’s workforce. Over the summer, the company said “adverse financial conditions” forced Xcor to terminate its remaining employees."
"Paragraph: Alabama's Senate race has become a tossup, a new poll says. About 550,000 homes in Southern California have the highest risk of fire damage. The California state Senate is changing how it handles sexual harassment complaints. Enrollment of first-time international students in U.S. colleges dipped last year. "

Article Content: Once a darling of the Mojave aerospace start-up scene, spaceplane builder Xcor Aerospace has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.A court document filed last week with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of California says the company has more than 100 creditors and assets estimated between $1 million and $10 million.Xcor’s liabilities are estimated in the filing to be between $10 million and $50 million.In a message sent last week to investors and company shareholders, Xcor Chief Executive Michael Blum and Chairman Tom Burbage said their effort to “find a financial future for Xcor has not succeeded.”The company said it had had “promising” discussions about potentially joining a consortium led by a “large aerospace firm” that would develop space access capabilities in Britain, and also held extensive talks with several groups of investors who were interested in developing a space tourism business.As recently as two weeks ago, a new party had expressed interest in Xcor but “did not have the financial capabilities initially portrayed to us,” the letter states. Ultimately the company said its senior secured creditor became “difficult to work with, necessitating a bankruptcy filing.”“Today it is my sad duty to inform you that Xcor has failed,” the letter states. “I am sorry that XCOR has let you down. I share your disappointment.”Nearly 10 years ago, Xcor unveiled plans for its Lynx suborbital space plane that was intended to take tourists to the edge of space for at least $100,000 a ride.The company was seen as a rival to British billionaire Richard Branson’s space tourism start-up, Virgin Galactic, and even got the attention of NASA, which awarded Xcor a contract that did not provide funds but indicated the agency’s interest in eventually purchasing flights from the company to take experiments into suborbital space.But Xcor underestimated the project’s complexity and the funding needed to develop the Lynx. Though Xcor also had an engine business, analysts said it did not have a diverse customer base.In 2015, Xcor relocated its headquarters from Mojave, Calif. to Midland, Texas. Last year, it said it would suspend construction on the Lynx space plane and laid off 50 to 60 employees — about half of the company’s workforce. Over the summer, the company said “adverse financial conditions” forced Xcor to terminate its remaining employees.Alabama's Senate race has become a tossup, a new poll says. About 550,000 homes in Southern California have the highest risk of fire damage. The California state Senate is changing how it handles sexual harassment complaints. Enrollment of first-time international students in U.S. colleges dipped last year.

"Paragraph: The Marlborough School announced Monday that it has reached a settlement with an unnamed former student who was sexually abused by Joseph Koetters, her English teacher."
"Paragraph: The settlement, whose terms are confidential, came just before the case was set to go to trial and one month after the school settled with Chelsea Burkett, 33, who also was sexually abused by Koetters when she was a teenager. The women sued Marlborough for failing to protect them from sexual abuse."
"Paragraph: “I hope that our schools will take real steps to shut down predatory behavior from here forward, so that no other girls will have to go through what Chelsea and I have gone through,” the unnamed former student said in a statement. “This case should serve as a warning to educators that ignoring their responsibilities to the children in their care can result in serious consequences. I hope that the protection of students starts to take priority over the need to protect a school's reputation.”"
"Paragraph: Priscilla Sands, who heads the prestigious Hancock Park all-girls school, sent out news of the settlement to people affiliated with the school."
"Paragraph: “We deeply regret and apologize for all that happened to both women as students,” Sands wrote. “We will be forever grateful to our alumnae for their bravery in coming forward, and truly believe Marlborough is a better environment today because of what we have learned through this process.”"
"Paragraph: “This litigation may be behind us, but our work is far from over,” Sands continued. “I pledge that transparency and advocacy for our students will remain our priorities.”"
"Paragraph: David Ring, the attorney who represented both women, said in a statement that his clients were pleased. \"This was incredibly difficult litigation for these two women,” he said. “But both of these courageous women stuck with it to the end. ... We are proud that we raised awareness that teacher-student abuse can occur anywhere, even in the most prestigious and elite private schools.\""
"Paragraph: Marlborough hired Koetters in 1999, after he taught at the private Viewpoint School in Calabasas. The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, claimed that Marlborough “knew, had reason to know and was otherwise on notice that Koetters had previously engaged in unlawful sexual activities.”"
"Paragraph: According to the lawsuit, in the spring of 2004 Koetters began paying special attention in and out of class to the young woman identified as Doe 2. He chose an explicit book, “Pussy, King of the Pirates,” for her to read as an extra assignment, and met with her outside class to discuss it."
"Paragraph: The complaint states that Koetters “took advantage of Plaintiff’s fragile mental state during a vulnerable time” in her life. He told her his marriage was one of convenience and that he and she shared a “special connection.”"
"Paragraph: Later that school year, they kissed on a trail, and then were involved for several months in unlawful sexual conduct, the complaint states. She was 16. Koetters was in his mid-30s. The relationship ended when Koetters’ wife gave birth and the teenage girl went away for the summer, the lawsuit said."
"Paragraph: During the next school year, the plaintiff overheard a younger girl discuss Koetters’ advances, the lawsuit said. She confronted Koetters, who denied them."
"Paragraph: Like Burkett, the woman identified as Doe 2 relived her trauma in 2014 when she read an anonymous article published by another student that detailed a relationship with a teacher identifiable as Koetters."
"Paragraph: In 2015, she spoke to a therapist and shared her story in full for the first time. It was at that point, the lawsuit states, that she first realized Koetters had harmed her and “that her psychological injury as an adult was caused by the sexual abuse committed by Koetters during her high school years.”"
"Paragraph: Law enforcement authorities investigated Koetters and arrested him in connection with his alleged abuse of Burkett and Doe 2. In 2015, after pleading guilty to charges that he had engaged in sexual acts with the two when they were teenagers, Koetters was sentenced to a year in jail."
"Paragraph: Burkett and the woman identified as Doe 2 also settled with Viewpoint School this weekend, the school’s attorney confirmed. “There is a settlement and it’s confidential. That’s what I’m authorized to say,” said attorney Patricia Glaser of Glaser Weil Fink Howard Avchen & Shapiro. “It’s important for everyone to put it behind us.”"
"Paragraph: The women sued the school for fraud, stating that its administrators knew that “Koetters engaged in serious misconduct, including sexual harassment of girls” but Viewpoint “wanted to rid itself of Koetters in an efficient way.” So Viewpoint, their lawsuits stated, gave Koetters a positive recommendation and said that he parted from the school on “good terms.”"
"Paragraph: Representatives of Viewpoint did not immediately return requests for comment. A Marlborough spokeswoman said the school had nothing to add beyond Sands’ message."
"Paragraph: \"Sexual abuse and sexual assault are increasingly in the spotlight, and the opportunity to turn public outcry and #metoo into sustained change is boundless,” Burkett said in a statement. “I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished these past three and a half years, but there’s much work to come in holding organizations, industries and lawmakers accountable to a much higher standard.\""

"Paragraph: To the editor: I am a former high school teacher. During numerous class discussions, I listened to many, many students reveal that they were the victims of sexual abuse. (“Another accuser comes forward against Roy Moore,” Nov. 13)"
"Paragraph: Listening to their stories was heartbreaking, and I always wondered why some of them waited so long to “tell.” What I learned was that “kids never tell.”"
"Paragraph: I don't know if it was fear, guilt, confusion or some intuitive sense that what happened was just too wrong to discuss. I heard sexual abuse stories, often, 10 years after the incidents, so I knew for sure that only the atmosphere in the class and the trust they had in me gave them enough courage to confess the abuses they suffered."
"Paragraph: I hope the public that has no real knowledge of the vast incidents of sexual abuse does not dismiss these women as liars or having other motives. I know that a victim of any sort of sexual abuse does not react in the same way one would if attacked differently. Please believe them."

Article Content: To the editor: I am a former high school teacher. During numerous class discussions, I listened to many, many students reveal that they were the victims of sexual abuse. (“Another accuser comes forward against Roy Moore,” Nov. 13)Listening to their stories was heartbreaking, and I always wondered why some of them waited so long to “tell.” What I learned was that “kids never tell.”I don't know if it was fear, guilt, confusion or some intuitive sense that what happened was just too wrong to discuss. I heard sexual abuse stories, often, 10 years after the incidents, so I knew for sure that only the atmosphere in the class and the trust they had in me gave them enough courage to confess the abuses they suffered.I hope the public that has no real knowledge of the vast incidents of sexual abuse does not dismiss these women as liars or having other motives. I know that a victim of any sort of sexual abuse does not react in the same way one would if attacked differently. Please believe them.Phyllis Molloff, Fallbrook..To the editor: If someone in the entertainment business is accused of sexual abuse in one form or another, industry support is immediately terminated. And so it should be.If one is running for the presidency or a seat in the United States Senate, political parties feign disgust but continue to support the accused on the chance that the allegations are untrue.Alleged Hollywood abusers, are you listening?

"Paragraph: Uber said Sunday that it has struck a deal clearing the path for an investor group led in part by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank  to buy a stake in the ride-hailing giant."
"Paragraph: The deal could be worth as much as $10 billion and would include changes to Uber’s board operations, according to a person with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly."
"Paragraph: “We believe this agreement is a strong vote of confidence in Uber’s long-term potential,” an Uber spokesman said in a statement. “Upon closing, it will help fuel our investments in technology and our continued expansion at home and abroad, while strengthening our corporate governance.”"
"Paragraph: The investor group — which along with SoftBank is led by San Francisco investment firm Dragoneer — plans to buy about $1 billion worth of newly issued shares and make a tender offer for about 14% of Uber’s existing shares, the source familiar with the deal said. That tender offer could total about $9 billion based on the company's current valuation of $69 billion."
"Paragraph: If the deal closes, Uber will in turn enact corporate governance changes that hew closely to an overhaul its board approved last month. A source with knowledge of the matter said the deal comes with a resolution to have an initial public offering by 2019."
"Paragraph: First off, the deal would bring in money, which Uber could use to help fund expansion and operations amid growing competition from U.S. rival Lyft."
"Paragraph: Running a ride-hailing company isn’t cheap. Low fares attract more passengers, but they force ride-hailing firms to dip into their fundraising hauls to subsidize drivers."
"Paragraph: A hefty new investment could help persuade Lyft to stop challenging Uber on price, said Evan Rawley, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota who has followed the trajectory of both companies since their beginnings."
"Paragraph: “They need the money in the sense that they need to be strong enough so Lyft isn’t tempted to continue the price war,” he said. "
"Paragraph: “If they didn’t have enough cash in the bank, Lyft might be tempted to continue fighting them tooth and nail.”"
"Paragraph: But perhaps more important, the deal could help bring peace to a company defined in 2017 by scandal and infighting."
"Paragraph: According to Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, the long-anticipated SoftBank investment could soon be finalized because of an accord between former chief executive Travis Kalanick and early Uber investor Benchmark."
"Paragraph: Kalanick resigned as CEO in June after a string of controversies, including a lawsuit by Google self-driving-car spinoff Waymo alleging theft of trade secrets; a lawsuit by a woman in India who alleged Uber obtained her medical records after she was raped by one of the company’s drivers; and widespread allegations of sexual harassment at the firm."
"Paragraph: Benchmark filed suit against Kalanick in August, alleging that the Uber co-founder committed an act of fraud when he persuaded the board in 2016 to give him appointment power over three new board seats without first informing them of scandals that would soon consume the company and lead to his forced resignation."
"Paragraph: The two financial publications both reported Sunday that Benchmark had agreed to drop its lawsuit against Kalanick, clearing the way for the SoftBank deal."
"Paragraph: Putting to rest the spat between Kalanick and Benchmark could help Uber's new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, lead the company away from a period of tumult."
"Paragraph: The deal could also give board members who are dissatisfied with the company’s direction a way to cash out before an IPO. A sell-off could further ease tensions, which could allow Khosrowshahi to lead the company with less boardroom infighting. "
"Paragraph: A third benefit is that Uber would get connected with SoftBank — a hugely influential Japanese corporation that has a lot of money it wants to put into tech firms."
"Paragraph: SoftBank is a Japanese multinational corporation best known as a domestic telecom and internet service provider. But its founder and chief executive, Masayoshi Son, has also pushed it to aggressively invest in overseas companies across different categories. It bought Sprint in 2013 for $20 billion. It was an early investor in Yahoo and Alibaba. It put $4.4 billion into New York commercial real estate startup WeWork in August. And it has invested in ride-hailing companies across Asia such as Didi Chuxing, Grab and Ola."
"Paragraph: It’s also in the process of distributing a $100-billion “Vision Fund” (with money from Apple, Foxconn and the investment funds of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates), and claims it will put together an even larger follow-up fund, for global investments."
"Paragraph: SoftBank isn’t interested in being just a telecommunications company, according to analysts and business experts who have followed its evolution. Even though it got its start in 1981 as the mobile phone division of Japan Telecom and later bought Vodafone Japan, its chief executive has always had an eye on the rest of the world."
"Paragraph: “SoftBank is an incredibly unique company in Japan in the sense that it is very aggressive, both domestically and internationally,” said Jesper Koll, chief executive of WisdomTree Investments’ Japan unit. “It’s very much driven by Masayoshi Son.”"
"Paragraph: Unlike Japan’s conservative business leaders, the 60-year-old Son, who was born in Japan but is of Korean descent, is described by analysts as an outsider given to bucking trends. A UC Berkeley alum with an engineering background, Son was quick to embrace the “American venture capital and networking style.”"
"Paragraph: “He’s an upstart and he’s completely not Japanese establishment,” Koll said."
"Paragraph: “SoftBank wants to be a global leader in tech,” said Kirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research who has covered the telecommunications industry in Asia. “And I don’t mean just in internet. They look all the way up and down the value chain.”"
"Paragraph: The company’s investments span industries such as telecommunications, finance, media, e-commerce and transportation, with bets on companies that Son believes could be major players in the coming years, decades or even centuries."
"Paragraph: “He’s laid out a 300-year plan for SoftBank,” James Moore, director of Georgetown’s Business, Society and Public Policy Initiative, said of SoftBank’s CEO. “That’s one of the things that’s been unnerving for some of the outfits that have put up money for him — he’s not getting a return on investment in the next 24 hours. He takes the long view. Like with his investment in Alibaba, he’s looking for opportunities he can invest in today, recognizing that their returns can be massive down the road.”"
"Paragraph: Analysts see the acquisition of Sprint as one such investment. The U.S. telecom might be ranked fourth in the country, but with the right merger or acquisition, it could potentially give AT&T and Verizon a run for their money."
"Paragraph: SoftBank’s investments across multiple on-demand transportation companies — many of which are rivals — are also seen as part of a long play. In the event that ride-hailing turns out to be a winner-takes-all industry, SoftBank will at least have backed the winning horse. And if there’s room for two, SoftBank wins, too."
"Paragraph: “It’s extremely unique,” Moore said. “For American entrepreneurs, there’s a certain competitiveness. Steve Jobs would not have invested in Bill Gates. We pit companies against one another and see who comes out.”"
"Paragraph: That has been the case with the U.S. on-demand transportation industry, too. Venture capital firms that invest in Uber generally do not also invest in its rival Lyft."
"Paragraph: For Son, though, investing is less about pride and more about getting the most value out of something, analysts said."
"Paragraph: In Japan, the company has facilitated numerous mergers, and it’s “always trying to figure out how to win through consolidation,” said Hans Tung, managing partner at GGV Capital, an Alibaba investor that saw firsthand how SoftBank helped the Chinese e-commerce company grow."
"Paragraph: Overseas, SoftBank secured itself a stake in China’s largest taxi app by investing in Kuaidi Dache, which in 2015 merged with rival Didi Dache. The combined entity later acquired Uber’s China business and renamed itself Didi Chuxing."
"Paragraph: By investing in Uber, SoftBank would have a stake in the biggest ride-hailing players across Asia and the West."
"Paragraph: It’s easy to forget that SoftBank owns Sprint. But the company was harder to ignore last December when Son was seen shaking hands with then-President-elect Trump in Trump Tower, promising to bring some 50,000 jobs to the United States and invest $50 billion from SoftBank’s $100-billion Vision Fund in American businesses."
"Paragraph: “When you’re walking in the door with $100 billion, you’re the 800-pound gorilla in the room,” said Moore."
"Paragraph: Son has an even more ambitious target for his next fund, which he has already discussed with Japan’s Nikkei Business Daily."
"Paragraph: And though it’s an impressive sum of money, analysts don’t believe SoftBank will pose a threat to other major players in the United States anytime soon."
"Paragraph: “When you look at SoftBank in terms of the global internet universe, it’s not that big,” said Boodry. “Amazon, Google, Facebook, Alibaba and Tencent all have market caps of more than $450 billion, whereas SoftBank’s is around $100 billion.”"
"Paragraph: What Son does have going for him is a strong investment track record, said analysts, many of whom are confident that the Vision Fund will at the very least make back its money."
"Paragraph: Another thing he has going for him: Nobody else is bringing close to $100 billion to the private equity and start-up table, and few firms are investing as ambitiously around the world. It might not pay off right away, analysts said, but SoftBank is playing the long game — 300 years long, in fact."
"Paragraph: The group led by SoftBank and Dragoneer would buy $1 billion to $1.25 billion worth of new shares issued by Uber at the San Francisco ride-hailing giant’s current valuation of about $69 billion. The group also would issue a tender offer — expected in about two weeks — to buy about 14% of existing shares from current investors at a price that is not yet determined."
"Paragraph: If that happens, the person said, the following corporate governance changes would kick in:"
"Paragraph: - Uber would adopt a “one share, one vote” model to ensure parity in decision-making. The change would revoke “super-voting” rights, under which some shareholders have outsized power."
"Paragraph: - Uber’s board would grow to 17 seats from 11. SoftBank would hold two of those six new seats. There would be three new independent seats and one independent chairperson."
"Paragraph: - Uber could not appoint a new CEO without approval from two-thirds of the board. This requirement would be lifted after the company’s initial public offering."
"Paragraph: - Nobody could be appointed to any of the three board seats controlled by former CEO Kalanick without approval from a majority of the board. Under the deal, Kalanick “would not have a lot of power,” according to Rawley."
"Paragraph: - Uber would resolve to go public by 2019."

"Paragraph: The successful completion of a Brexit trade deal will help counter the threat posed by Russia to European security, Prime Minister Theresa May has said."
"Paragraph: She cited the use of disinformation and cyber warfare and Russia's alleged meddling in elections as proof of its aim to \"undermine free societies\"."
"Paragraph: The UK did not want \"perpetual confrontation\" with Russia but would protect its interests, she added."
"Paragraph: The UK wants a new security treaty with the EU after it leaves in 2019. "
"Paragraph: The UK government, which earlier this year reinforced its military presence in the Baltics by sending a further 800 troops to Estonia, has said it remains unconditionally committed to maintaining and defending European security once it has left the European Union."
"Paragraph: In a major foreign policy speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet at Mansion House in London, Mrs May warned the post-war international order was under unprecedented threat from states trying to \"destabilise it for their own ends\". "
"Paragraph: She said as the UK left the EU and charted a new course in the world it remained absolutely committed to Nato and securing a Brexit deal which \"strengthens our liberal values\", adding that a strong economic partnership between the UK and EU would be a bulwark against Russian agitation in Europe."
"Paragraph: \"The comprehensive new partnership we seek will underpin our shared commitment to open economies and free societies in the face of those who seek to undermine them,\" she said. "
"Paragraph: \"Chief among those today is Russia.\""
"Paragraph: Delivering what she described as a \"very simple message\" for President Vladimir Putin, she said he must choose a very \"different path\" from the one that in recent years had seen Moscow annex Crimea, foment conflict in Ukraine and launch cyber attacks on governments and Parliaments across Europe. "
"Paragraph: Russia could be a valuable partner of the West but only if it \"plays by the rules\", she argued."
"Paragraph: \"Russia has repeatedly violated the national airspace of several European countries and mounted a sustained campaign of cyber espionage and disruption. This has included meddling in elections and hacking the Danish Ministry of Defence and the Bundestag among many others.\""
"Paragraph: \"We know what you are doing and you will not succeed. Because you underestimate the resilience of our democracies, the enduring attraction of free and open societies and the commitment of Western nations to the alliances that bind us.\""
"Paragraph: Boris Johnson, who will make his first trip to Russia as foreign secretary later this year, has said the UK's policy to Russia must be one of \"beware but engage\" following a decade of strained relations. "
"Paragraph: He told MPs earlier this month that he had not seen any evidence of Russia trying to interfere in British elections or the 2016 Brexit vote, in which Moscow has insisted it remained neutral. "
"Paragraph: \"We will take the necessary action to counter Russian activity,\" Mrs May added. \"But this not where we want to be and not the relationship with Russia we want."
"Paragraph: \"We do not want to return to the Cold War or to be in a state of perpetual confrontation."
"Paragraph: \"As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia has the reach and the responsibility to play a vital role in promoting international stability."
"Paragraph: \"Russia can, and I hope one day will, choose this different path. But for as long as Russia does not, we will act together to protect our interests and the international order on which they depend.\""
"Paragraph: In her speech, she also said the authorities in Myanmar must take \"full responsibility\" for what \"looked like ethnic cleansing\" of the Rohingya people in Rakhine province. "
"Paragraph: MPs and peers will be given a take-it-or-leave it say on agreement via an Act of Parliament, David Davis says."

"Paragraph: A fourth woman has accused Alabama senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual assault as Republicans have increased calls for him to \"step aside\"."
"Paragraph: Beverly Young Nelson told reporters that Mr Moore had tried to force himself on her after offering her a ride home from her job as a waitress."
"Paragraph: \"I tried fight him off while yelling at him to stop,\" she said, adding that he locked his car to prevent her escape."
"Paragraph: Mr Moore, 70, denies the allegations, describing them as a \"witch hunt\"."
"Paragraph: However, US Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said earlier on Monday that he believed the women accusing Mr Moore of inappropriate behaviour. "
"Paragraph: Mrs Nelson's accusation comes after three other women detailed allegations of sexual assault by the conservative firebrand while they were teenagers in Alabama."
"Paragraph: \"I was determined that I was not going to allow him to force me to have sex with him,\" Mrs Nelson tearfully told reporters in New York, describing how he allegedly drove her to the back of the restaurant car park. "
"Paragraph: \"I was terrified. He was also trying to pull my shirt off. I thought he was going to rape me."
"Paragraph: \"I was twisting, and I was struggling and I was begging him to stop. I had tears running down my face."
"Paragraph: \"At some point he gave up and he then looked at me and he told me, 'You're just a child,' and he said, 'I am the district attorney of Etowah County and if you tell anyone about this no one will ever believe you\", Mrs Nelson said, adding that her neck was bruised in the struggle."
"Paragraph: \"He finally allowed me to open the door and I either fell out or he pushed me out.\""
"Paragraph: She added: \"The passenger door was still open as he burned rubber, pulling away, leaving me laying there on this cold concrete in the dark.\""
"Paragraph: Mr Moore's wife also vehemently denies the allegations, contending that her husband's accusers are being paid. "
"Paragraph: Mr McConnell told reporters in his home state of Kentucky on Monday that party officials were considering whether another Republican could challenge Mr Moore in next month's election, through a so-called write-in challenge."
"Paragraph: He said Luther Strange, whom Mr Moore beat in the Republican primary earlier this year, was a possible option."
"Paragraph: Senator Cory Gardner, the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, said of Mr Moore on Monday: \"If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate.\" "
"Paragraph: No matter what happens between now and the 12 December election, Mr Moore's name will remain on the voters' ballot, the Alabama secretary of state has confirmed."
"Paragraph: Alabama law prohibits the replacement of a party candidate up to 76 days before the election."
"Paragraph: However, voters are free to \"write-in\" any name they choose and the party might encourage support for another Republican candidate. "
"Paragraph: The state Republican party could also disqualify Mr Moore's nomination, meaning that if he won the most votes he would still not be declared the winner."
"Paragraph: Failing that, if Mr Moore won the election, the US Senate could vote to expel him by arguing that he lacked fitness to serve."
"Paragraph: Last week's Washington Post story quoted four women by name, including one who alleged Mr Moore initiated sexual contact with her when she was 14 - beneath the legal age of consent in Alabama - while he was a prosecutor in his 30s."
"Paragraph: Mr Moore has said the Washington Post story is a fabricated smear by his political opponents, calling it \"a prime example of fake news\"."
"Paragraph: Mr McConnell previously said Mr Moore should step aside only if the allegations were proven true."
"Paragraph: But on Monday he said flatly: \"I believe the women. Yes.\""
"Paragraph: Mr Moore hit back in a tweet: \"The person who should step aside is @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell. He has failed conservatives and must be replaced. #DrainTheSwamp\"."
"Paragraph: He sent out a fundraising email with the subject line: \"Mitch McConnell's plot to destroy me.\""
"Paragraph: Mr Moore, an outspoken Christian conservative, had been a heavy favourite to win the 12 December election against Democrat Doug Jones."
"Paragraph: But an opinion poll after the allegations surfaced suggested the race was tightening. Alabama has not elected a Democratic senator in a quarter of a century."
"Paragraph: MPs and peers will be given a take-it-or-leave it say on agreement via an Act of Parliament, David Davis says."

"Paragraph: Emma Dent Coad wrote a blog piece in 2010 in which she labelled Shaun Bailey a \"token ghetto boy\"."
"Paragraph: Mr Bailey said the MP should apologise for the \"hate-filled, racist article\"."
"Paragraph: A spokesman for Ms Dent Coat, who was elected to Kensington in June, said she had been quoting Mr Bailey's \"own comments about parts of the borough\"."
"Paragraph: In the piece Ms Dent Coad claimed Mr Bailey, who was a parliamentary candidate for Hammersmith, had \"stigmatised\" the area he was born in by referring to it as a \"ghetto\"."
"Paragraph: \"Who can say where this man will ever fit in, however hard he tries? One day he is the 'token ghetto boy' standing behind D Cameron, the next 'looking interested' beside G Osborne. Ever felt used?,\" she wrote."
"Paragraph: After the blog post was highlighted, Mr Bailey said he had never been \"labelled a 'token ghetto boy'\" before and was \"shocked and saddened\" by the article."
"Paragraph: He said Ms Dent Coad's \"use of language should not be acceptable for an elected politician... and she should be ashamed\", he said."
"Paragraph: \"I am proud of where I am from and would certainly not use language like ghetto in a way to disparage the area I grew up in,\" the London Assembly member said."

"Paragraph: Midfielder Jakob Johansson's deflected strike in the first leg was the difference as the second leg at Milan's San Siro stadium ended goalless."

"Paragraph: Many of the Italy players fell to the ground at the full-time whistle, with strikers Andrea Belotti and Immobile reduced to tears, as the Swedes ran off to enthusiastically celebrate their qualification for next summer's tournament in Russia."
"Paragraph: Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport described the loss as the \"apocalypse\" in their headline for the match report. "
"Paragraph: Captain Gianluigi Buffon was earning his 175th cap for Italy and it may well be the 39-year-old goalkeeper's last international appearance having announced his decision to retire from football at the end of the season."
"Paragraph: AC Milan's highly-rated 18-year-old Gianluigi Donnarumma was on the bench and the teenager, who already has four caps, is in line to take over the number one shirt for the next campaign - qualifying for the 2020 European Championship."
"Paragraph: Buffon, who was also tearful at the final whistle, said: \"I am not sorry for myself but all of Italian football. We failed at something which also means something on a social level."
"Paragraph: \"There is certainly a future for Italian football, as we have pride, ability, determination and after bad tumbles, we always find a way to get back on our feet."

"Paragraph: He received much criticism for his decision to play a 4-2-4 formation against Spain, when his side were heavily beaten 3-0, and will once again be asked questions why he refused to play Napoli's Lorenzo Insigne, who has six goals already this season for his club side."

"Paragraph: Commonwealth champion Dan Keatings says he experienced a culture of \"bullying and manipulation\" throughout his time as a British gymnast."
"Paragraph: Keatings, 27, described retiring in January as a \"relief\", following a decade in elite gymnastics where he won world, European and Commonwealth honours."
"Paragraph: It follows claims by a group of coaches, denied by British Gymnastics, that \"appalling leadership\" within the national governing body had led to a \"culture of fear\" in the sport."
"Paragraph: \"That fear is very, very real,\" Keatings told BBC Sport."
"Paragraph: \"I'm one of the athletes that was never able to say anything because I was scared of not being selected for the team which then leads to losing funding.\""
"Paragraph: In a statement, British Gymnastics chief executive Jane Allen said: \"We have today been made aware of additional welfare concerns and encourage anyone with a concern or complaint to come forward. We offer our assurance that all matters will be dealt with appropriately and impartially. "
"Paragraph: \"Our safeguarding processes are robust and I can assure people that complaints and appeals, regardless of their nature, are dealt with fairly and effectively where we have the authority to act. This includes the two cases referred to in the Guardian article today and therefore we refute the accusations made."
"Paragraph: \"British Gymnastics has a track record of good governance as evidenced by our adherence to the UK Sport 'Code for Sports Governance'. "
"Paragraph: \"We take all of our responsibilities towards our staff, coaches, participants and elite athletes extremely seriously. We have robust governance policies and procedures to cover safeguarding, complaints, standards of conduct and GB team selections, all available online.\" "
"Paragraph: British Gymnastics is the latest national governing body in the UK to become embroiled in an athlete welfare controversy after inquiries into duty of care standards at British Swimming, British Canoeing, GB Taekwondo and the British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association [BBSA] among others in recent months."
"Paragraph: Keatings became Britain's first all-around World Championship medallist when he claimed silver in 2009, and says his problems in the sport grew after missing out on the London 2012 Olympics through injury."
"Paragraph: \"You're trying to train and basically become an Olympic medallist and people are putting you down all of the time,\" said Keatings, who says he was repeatedly called \"fat\" during training."
"Paragraph: \"There were times where I was really quite down and I'm pretty certain I was depressed at certain times,\" he said. \"There were times I didn't even want to leave the house.\" "
"Paragraph: Led by Max Whitlock's historic two Olympic titles, British gymnasts secured a record haul of seven medals at the Rio 2016 Games."
"Paragraph: However, Keatings - who missed the Games as a result of injury and a loss of form - believes the team's success has come at a cost."
"Paragraph: \"Obviously with gymnastics doing really well at the moment people think behind the scenes that everything is perfect, when that's not the case,\" said Keatings, who represented Scotland at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, where he won pommel horse gold and silver medals in the all-around and team events."
"Paragraph: \"When I finally announced I was retired it was like a big weight was lifted off my shoulders and honestly it shouldn't be like that."
"Paragraph: \"You should be happy that you've had the career you've had, but I was happy to get away from the sport and start a new life.\""
"Paragraph: Keatings, who now works as a 'process officer' for Weetabix, is pleased Whitlock and several other leading athletes have delayed signing new World Class Performance Programme contracts with British Gymnastics."
"Paragraph: Although no athletes have refused to sign, it is understood that a number are unhappy with the current commercial arrangements which some feel could impact their ability to make money outside the sport."
"Paragraph: \"I'm really happy because these guys are standing up to it,\" Keatings told BBC Sport."
"Paragraph: \"It's almost like British Gymnastics want complete control of people."
"Paragraph: \"There are people who are doing really well and going out and getting their own sponsors, but British Gymnastics want to grab a hold of that and put everything through them, which is restricting everything athletes can do.\""
"Paragraph: British Gymnastics says more than 50% of the athletes on the World Class Performance Programme have signed new contracts and that discussions with other athletes are ongoing."
"Paragraph: \"British Gymnastics is working hard to ensure that all athletes are comfortable with the agreement before signing because we respect their views on matters that directly impact them,\" Allen added. "
"Paragraph: \"Whilst we had planned to have the agreements signed before the Artistic World Championships in October, once it was understood that the athletes wanted more time to review the agreement, we naturally agreed to this."
"Paragraph: \"I am proud to lead an organisation committed to creating and inspiring lasting success for gymnastics, as well as driving through important and positive change. This can include making difficult decisions that may be challenged. "
"Paragraph: \"As CEO of British Gymnastics, I strive to instil a culture of honesty, openness, trust, respect and support. I always welcome debate and listen to constructive feedback.  "
"Paragraph: \"We want to make the nation proud but 'how we win' is just as important. This administration has never had a desire to win at any cost and under my leadership I expect the athletes' welfare to be given the highest priority.\""
